              "'1. the replacement blade is around rs.800/- and if you use this daily you may have to replace the blade on the 3rd or 2nd month.. 2. it\\'s just a trimmer, you have to slide the blade multiple times to get a very clean shave then also you\\'ll not be able to get a clean shave like aquatouch or your normal hand held manual blade.. 3. the pack and the advertisement mentions that the battery lasts for 90 mins in one single charge, but you have to charge it for 8 hours to get it all juiced up and then on a single shave you\\'ll spend atleast 15-20mins to get a clean shave because of it\\'s i\\'ll designed blade system. i received this on march 25, 2019. i haven\\'t changed the blade.. its 8 months still working fine.. the flexibility has improved too. the product needs to have a better battery life as blades become old, it takes a toll on battery life significantly.. the blades haven\\'t turned green yet.. about durability, sometimes the trimmer head felt delicate. the mechanics can be improved.. this product deserves 5 star if phillips can add battery life indicator, a bit bigger blade. i would absolutely avoid buying this.. even though the idea behind this is really noble but the design has many cost cutting. the interchange between the blades and machine is made up of fragile plastic which broke off in 3rd use.. i would now have to buy a blade which is of 850 rs. phillips simply does not seem to have quality control like gillette.. edit: changing my rating to 4 as philips were kind enough to call and take exact point of issue. this kind of customer service is expected from company like philips. hopefully they fix this problem in their second iteration. i purchased the oneblade so that i can control the trimmer the way i would a razor. and the oneblade does just that.. pros:. - ergonomic, easy to use like a razor. - perfect for styling beards, moustaches etc without a scissor or any other devices. - can give you a close trim, like a shaver, but it will take you a lot of time.. cons. - not easy to use against the grain. - have to be careful because the trimmer blades do touch the skin, kind of.. - took a little longer than i would a razor or a trimmer because i had to be a little cautious first impressions:. this product looks good. great packaging. easy to use.. after usage:. after using it for just one month my blade started to switch the color and now i cannot cut hair as smooth as the new blade. and the replacement blade is rs.849/- which is too costly to get a new each month.. this is just a trimmer, it cannot replace the original razer.. battery doesn\\'t last longer than 30 minutes.. i will not recommend this to anyone. it\\'s just a waste of money the blade is not like it is advertised:. 1. the first issue is with charging the trimmer. 8 hours of charging gets you only 15-20 mins of shave. a very big let down. 2. it is trimmer at best. you have to shave thorough enough to get a clean look like the traditional blades. so, if you are looking for the manual blade, it is not worth it.. 3. replacement blades are damn costly, money machine for philips.. i have used trimmer for the last 7 years before giving it a try, and to be frank i am disappointed with the product. it does not meet all my requirements, and the biggest of them is charging the device. too much time taking for just 20 mins of shave/trim. i\\'ll be straight up. i\\'ve used phillips products before. this one has been a disappointment. after 12 - 13 smooth runs, it stopped working mid way in a shave which gave a painful jerk as well. i cleaned the blade thoroughly. same has been happening again and again. - disappointed customer\\'s honest feedback. i have been using oneblade for almost a month now and my verdict is that the oneblade serves the best purpose as a travel companion rather than for daily use.. pros:. lightweight and sleek design: my philips trimmer is almost double the size than oneblade.. 2-in-1 use: you need not carry a trimmer and shaver when you travel as this can act as a shaver as well.. can use without water even for a full shave and works smoothly (hence you need not carry shaving cream, brush and all as additional accessories). cons:. a bit costlier. the shave is not clean and smooth as it is with a regular shaver (i use gillette mach 5). i had to do a \"touch up\" round with gillette after doing \"clean shave\" with oneblade. the hair near the neck area was very difficult to remove.. not so smooth when used wet. no charging/charge full indicator.. final verdict: i will be going back to my usual mach 5 for shaving and philips trimmer for trimming on a day to day basis, but this will definitely find a space (and save space) in my travel kit! it\\'s very convenient and easy to use shaver/trimer. due to its unique design it feels like normal razor can be controlled like one, which i think it\\'s usp.. the downside is battery charger is not of very good quality and kind of proprietory, and it takes a super long time to charge this. also, you can\\'t use it with power cord connected. it operates only in battery mode. come on 8 hours for 45 min play? this is too much. for this alone, i would prefer having the pro version. its costly and currently not available in india though. would buy that when available in india. pro version charges in 1 hour and gives 90 mins of backup.. update:. just after 2-3 uses, the blade started coming out loose. i thought its the issue with the blade, got a new one. to my surprise, the mechanism in the handle to lock the blade was broken. i thought it was a good product, but seems very delicate. not fit for purpose. it\\'s effortless, styles trims & shaves like a charm & looks super cool while doing it !. love the fact that i didn\\'t have to worry about any scratches / itchiness compared to both trimmers & shavers post a grooming session!. completely safe as it never touches the skin! awesome that it also has wet and dry capabilities!. it feels super premium to hold ! the perfect grooming tool that has ever existed till date!. \"one blade to rule them all \" i bought the product after seeing all the reviews and was skeptical until i received it. trust me when i say its the best shaver/trimmer i have ever used. it just glides on the face leaving no hair behind with not cuts or nicks, its almost close to blade shave. just have to wait and see how long the blades will be as sharp as they are because the replacement ones are pretty costly (1500 for two). all in all recommended! it is far better than my previous trimmer. specially zero trimming feature with intact soft skin is something new which i never found in any previous trimmer. handling is also very easy. we can make sharp cuts , edges easily .price is also in budget. we can do clean shave also with this. please don’t buy this product, it’s very difficult to use, most of the time wasted for cleaning, really convenient. now i can ditch my straight razor(ustra) and also my regular shaver.. i am giving it three stars because the replacement blades are of the same cost as the unit online. i could buy a new unit instead of buying the blades everytime. i hope phillips does something about that. pros:. 1) it looks stylish and colour is cool.. cons:. 1) battery is just 45min for 8 hrs charge, while other trimmer from philips. 2) very difficult if you are using from trimmer perspective because it cuts from 2 sides. usual one sided cutter trimmers are better at accuracy.. 3) warranty information is years and listed only for 2 years \"with registration\". i registered the product on philips website today(after 2.5 months of purchase) and didn\\'t get any warranty. when i registered b23221 trimmer, it shows warranty information clearly for it, so i guess i lost the warranty totally for my oneblade product.. not happy overall.. oneblade does trims more like shaving, i.e more closer trimming. but traditional b23221 like trimmers will also give expected results. worst battery life. can see 2 versions of this on amazon, one has a sub brand of norelco which is priced 2.5 times more expensive for no discernible difference.. i cant find a replacment blade which isnt branded norelco. the norelco 3 blade set is costing more than 3 of the instruments with the blades.. something has gone horribly wrong.. the product is light and trims well after 3-4 runs on the same area of your beard. i feel after 5-6 uses the blade has lost its edge. hence the search for a blade, that eludes me completely.. a charge indicator would be good. also the blade get hair stuck in it quite easily and often and its not easy to clean one of the biggest concerns when keeping a beard is styling it. with my frequent travel it becomes difficult to keep my beard well groomed. and hence i opted for the philip\\'s one blade trimmer.. ** its versatile and it is suitable for both wet and dry shave. ** it moves in either direction and has no risk of cuts. ** it is great for sensitive skin and provides the right trim and styling. excellent product from philips. oneblade is 3 in 1 blade with which you can trim, shape and shave. even i have doubt about the shaving part. before buying i went through youtube videos about oneblade uploaded by different users about their experiences. the oneblade in youtube was different but i found that reviews helpful in buying oneblade qp2525/10. this is the first time im using and oneblade. i had initial doubts whether i would be able to get a clean and smooth shave like i get with a shaving cartridge. after shave and shaping i felt my skin with my hand it was smooth and soft. oneblade has done job well. you can go for this product if you are looking for electric shaver. it is sure shot.. other plus poits are. 1. it comes with 5mm, 3mm and 1mm comb. which is easy to mount and dismount from blade. 2. its size perfect fit for hand. 3. perfect weight and ergonomic design. 4. you can wash the blade with water directly.. 5. 45 minutes continuous usage with 8 hour charge.. 6. attractive color.. the only minus point i think is that it does not come with extra blade although which you can buy separately.. go for it. :) :) let me tell you very truthfully that i am fully unsatisfied with this product. the quality of saving is very horrible by this trimmer. it needs to save again and again for cutting beared. after several times also you will not get good save. it fails in cutting neck hairs. i read so many good reviews about it before purchasing, but i feel unhappy to say that i was totally misguided by those reviews. i never suggest any one to buy it... i thought this to be a shaver and bought it. i could not returned it as well as there was no optiot to return and only replacer was allowed. so i dint bother the vendor and kept it as ot was my mistake.. its a actually trimmer. it trims really close. it has 3 options for trimming length. at zero level it trims well but in the neck area it could not clear all the hair and i had to shave with blade.. don\\'t go dor this if you want a shaver. else as a trimmer it may be useful. the philips oneblade is one of its kind. the perfect hybrid between a trimmer and shaver, it does the job of both. you could use it to give yourself some really nice shaves and trims and be up to date with the latest beard trends. it comes with 3 combs, to give you a trim of the length that you desire, and you can also use it without the combs for a clean shave. what is amazing is that you can use it even without water, and it gives the same effect. it does not leave the skin dry.. all in all, this is a great product, and kudos to philips for this. i have read reviews where people are complaining that it doesn\\'t give a clean shave, aquatouch much better and what not.... this product is not meant to give you a clean shave. it is for those who want to sport a stubble or those who want a near clean shave. i have the aquatouch and its great but iv had to stop using it because it causes acne on my skin.... this is where the oneblade comes in....... i use it daily as well as on travels and it works like a charm everytime. do not think that it will give you the clean shave i have tried my best to get clean shave but this trimmer is not giving the clean shave however you do upside down or downside up i\\'ve been looking for a product like this for a long time. as i first saw this product last year while travelling to usa but due to warranty issues i didn’t buy it, but when it launched in india with such a great price with 3 year warranty i couldn’t resist it and bought it from amazon. it\\'s not unusual for me to go long enough without shaving that i then have to use a trimmer before shaving. and as a stop gap between shaving just trimming means having to deal with it again shortly. i saw the ad on facebook the product claimed to also be a shaver but i had serious doubts.. well i used it for the first time today and it is far better than i had hoped.it looked like i had shaved. now it\\'s not as close as a blade but it\\'s about the same as an electric razor.. the best part is that it has a two sided blade which makes it easy to move in any direction you need. the top edge for example does a good job below the nose where an electric razor struggles. it also cuts chin hair better than an electric razor. and the best thing is that it trims precisely.. i can\\'t imagine using an electric razor again and would only use a blade if i needed a particularly close shave. it will be extremely nice to do away with trimming before shaving previously necessary after multiple days of not shaving. it will also be nice to be able to dry shave (even though it also wet shaves).. having said that i\\'m still extremely pleased to finally have something that trims and shaves in one step, dry shaves about as close as an electric razor and without the irritation of a blade even when using foam. brilliant technology and excellent product right that you need for body grooming. perfect size and most relevant is that it does the job without and cuts. must buy for all who purchase body grooming kit. when in time it can also be used for shaving but i would say more for body but does decent job for shaving too. charging time is a bit linger than required and battery usage could have been better. but that’s not a deal breaker. go for it for your night use. it\\'s a great product, easy to handle, manoeuvring over skin, or getting the perfect edges, it gets all done. i have been using q3387 for 3 years and i was satisfied with it. i consider one blade to be an upgrade over that. let me capture a few highlights:. 1. the design and look is very trendy and compact. it\\'s easy to grip and move over the skin. also very easy to carry for trips.. 2. the combs given fit perfectly and will enable you to maintain beards of desired length.. 3. it creates lot less noise.. 4. i used it twice and felt no itritation, i dare say it\\'s friendlier to skin.. 5. the finish is lot better and and i could achieve the desired outcome in lesser time compared to my experience with q3387.. in short, it\\'s a very handy performance tool and definitely a good value for money provided the cartridge keeps on giving the same output for the duration mentioned. firts shave it worked left it to charge after that. it does get stuck when the beard has gron can use comb attachments to reduce and finally trim.. second tme i tried again getting stuck removed hair removed blase used pressurized water to claean blade and reinserted when dried.. tried couple of times to fix the blade. unit does not turn on after charging for over a day. jt is spoiled and gone. maybe seller isn selling as neew but recycled product. money wasted and product needs to be thrown away.. useless product. not woth it. try a professional clipper instead which is cheaper than this philips unit. i was happy with this product till today until my blades got broken. as everyone i searched for replacement blades and it\\'s way to expensive. expensive than the whole trimmer itself!!! so before spending money on this think twice, this is very delicate and replacements are so expensive. pros:-. i felt it is the best overall shave and trimmer available. very simple and easy to use. can give you a close shave/ trim the way you want it. wet or dry. very good control over your trimming with three attachments for 1mm, 3mm, 5 mm and of course freehand without the attachment.. cons:-. 1. the blade is supposed to be replaced once every 4 months. i am really monitoring it and will update how it wears out over time. the replacement is pretty expensive. a simple math i did against a gillette fusion razor makes it 30% more expensive every quarter, but of course philips one blade yields more value by providing grooming provisions, so i feel it still fair since i can avoid an early haircut.. 2. the model i bought on amazon does not have a battery status indicator on the blade handle, but instead an orange light on the charger adapter, which makes no sense. this only indicates that the adaptor is on.. 3. i have a lot of other charging adaptors from philips with other products bought earlier. but none of them fit this. this again looks like the philips sales strategy of selling their own adaptors instead of adapting universal ones and also making sure they multiply sales using different connect constraints for each product. i hate them for this. i have a separate box at home for their different adapters.. overall, i love this idea. you can carry it in your hand baggage for travel through an airport, still get a great shave and trim before your meetings. excellent product for sensitive skin. i had an aqua touch before which i could not use much because of skin irritation. i was skeptical whether this product can perform a clean shave but after using it for a month i could say i found the perfect product suitable for my usage. it takes a while to get used to it. battery life is quit good (used 6 times after first charge and still some juice is left). also it does not sharpen the beard like the way mach 3 does. can\\'t tell about trimmer performance as i have not used them, as per youtube reviews 1 mm does the job but others are of no use.. tips:. use dry shave. wash face with warm water before. use it against the grain. wish the blade prices will reduce in near future and be available online unlike aquatouch blades the product is very bad the blade is very very fragile if you apply even a little more force while trimming the blade will be broken and the shaving is also not very smooth. the product can also not be returned so i suggest you to not buy this product. back when they were promoting this product on amazon’s homepage it really looked like a good trimmer and value for money, so i bought it and it really is a good trimmer. but the downside is the price of the blades. one unit of one blade replacement blade goes for ₹849 which means that for only price of a few blades, you can get a new one blade trimmer. i feel cheated :( 1) my old trimmer costing rs 900 does the same job.. 2) and no!!! you cannot use it for a clean shave as shown in the ad video. it does not give you a clean shave. it leaves a light stubble. i doubt if it was a continuous shot video without the intervention of the stylist.. 3) the ad says it is washable but the product guide has marked x mark with a water tap sign.. 4) its not easy to do styling as shown in the video.. 5) no pics showing how to use the product.. 6) the product does not have any wow factor. i read the good reviews and proceeded to buy this the first day it was running great but then the third day i started getting cuts and from that day everyday shaving without 2 to 3 cuts is impossible i thought that i was keeping too much pressure or was doing it the wrong way but after trying everything still was hurting and the blade wears out very quickly and to replace that it’s costs 800₹ just for one replacement peice. and after shaving the hair gets stuck in the blade and it’s very hard to take out. i recommend you to not buy this product at all but if you want to still buy it i don’t know what will convince you to not. never expected this from phillips one of the worst product from phillips just to mob your money. the blades last for 3 to 5 months maximum and replacement blades price is same as new other phillips trimmer. plus if you want to get it delivered they ask for delivery price. in short never go for one blade. you will get other products similar and better. only thing is good is battery life. i too have to order new trimmer as one blade is more or less a shaver not a trimmer. worst product purchased from amazon till date and they now asking for delivery charge for a replacement blade. pathetic !! i had a panasonic 3 blade shaver which i got from us in 2012. it was around 150 $ but this philips one blade beats it straight. it is awesome , super fast n extremely convenient.it is quite affordable. at a price of 2199, it is almost a steal. not efficient for shaving/zero trimming(if you have 6-7 mm beard) as the blade easily looses it\\'s sharpness after using it thrice.. i wanted to use it to clean shave the sides to create a shape with the beard but seems it won\\'t help as it\\'s no closer to clean shave. i will need a good razor to do that.. this trimmer may be good for those who want to trim 1mm,3mm,5mm using combs which are provided by philips or zero trim (for those who have short beard).. if you already have a philips 7000 series multi groomer i.e. body + beard trimmer then there is no point buying this oneblade. this product is technically a styler. it should not be misleadingly sold as a shaver, which is what is done. it does not provide an even shave. flat areas look clean, curved areas have stubble more than 2-3 mm. sometimes it cuts and leads to skin bleeds, while it is marketed as a device that does not cut skin. also irritates skin. a normal single or doble blade razor would be better for shaving. i need to keep my beard in shape everytime. oneblade is the best trimmer i could get. i can easily shape my beard with the great clean look.. battery life is awesome. on a single charge i can shape my beard for almost 7-8 times as i take 5 mins to shape my beard.. it is very easy to use the attachment for the blade is very easy to attach and remove.. as this is water proof it becomes very convenient to clean. just running it under the tap water.. this blade have an indication on the blade itself. so that i can get to know when should i change the blade.. very impressed with this trimmer!!! for full shaves this is the closest you will get - couple it with a non-foaming shaving gel you will get a zero irritation shave in 2 mins. one of the best products i have ever bought. prior to buying this i have used trimmers/shavers from braun, philips, nova, wahl. but after i bought this philips one blade, the rest are pretty much junk. pros:. * takes very less time to trim down the longest and bushirst of beards.. * very safe to use. accidental cuts will not occur. * can be used with or without foam.. * battery lasts long enough to complete 2 shaves (after that, the movement of the blade slows down and is less effective). cons:. * the blade loses sharpness very quickly compared to shaving razors like gillette fusion.. * the blade is quite expensive to replace. * inconvenient to use on skin that has beard growth in multiple angles. the oneblade is effective only when it is run against the grain of hair growth (this also means that only one side of the blade can get overused and will get blunt faster). so it will require multiple runs in multiple angles to clean out all hair sometimes. this can also leave a very irritated skin.. * shaving on dry skin (without gel/foam) with the oneblade scatters hair all around and makes it messy to clean afterwards.. * not cost effective for regular shaves when compared to even premium razors like the gillette fusion blades that last much longer. this product is good for shave.. stable beard trimmings , i am not sure if it\\'s possible.. also while charging, no light on trimmer which makes us practically impossible to know if it\\'s charged or not.. suitable for those people who wants to shave (not perfect shave) but want to do it fast. no need to take blade ,shaving cream. during lockdown who dune want to go to barber shop it\\'s best choice.. but based on other reviews it seems not suitable for people who shave regularly as the blade cost is more.. the picture uploaded using this trimmer shaved after 1 month. the shaver , trimmer bought from amazon philips is a hopeless product which does nothing on both the accounts and i am totally disappointed. the return window is closed and i am left with no other option but to dump it my drawer some where as i totally regret.. don’t be led by a brand and i will still like the seller or the company to come forward and take it back or exchange it with some better product the product overall is good in terms of shaving/trimming experience. i wish it had fast charging facility, else you would have to plan 8 hours in advance of deciding to get a shave. it can be a nice back-up/travel shaver. the box content had a leaflet about a 50% off on first blade order, but i never got the \\'coupon code\\' after registering on philips website. blades are for sure expensive by all means. i used the trimmer only once, it is 97% close to razor type shaving result. after first use itself, the green background started to appear slightly on the blades, notifying the need to replace the blade. dual-sided blade. oneblade follows the contours of your face, allowing you to easily and comfortably style all areas. go against the grain. use the dual-sided blade to get your style. wet & dry. oneblade is water resistant, so it is easy to clean: just rinse it under the tap. you can also shave with or without foam - whichever you prefer.. durable oneblade. the blades are designed for lasting performance. for optimal performance, you will only need to replace each blade every 4 months. replacement is easy and hassle free.. for best shaving experience. based on 2 full shaves per week. actual results may vary. durable oneblade. the blades are designed for lasting performance. for optimal performance, you will only need to replace each blade every 4 months. replacement is easy and hassle free.. for best shaving experience. based on 2 full shaves per week. actual results may vary. i trust phillips blindly that\\'s what led me into buying this trimmer. it is a total waste of time and money. user experience is very bad. a razor is much better than managing this trimmer. going through small edges is quite a tedious job and involves lots of efforts and time. moreover a smart move by phillips is that they are encashing on the blade. the blade will ware out soon n replacing it is too costly.. don\\'t buy it.... used around 5-6 different trimmer before this but this stand-out of all.. design : handle is thick and had good grip making it easier to handle and shave. size of blade is good enough to decrease time of shaving as well making it morr easier to shave at curves. colour is vibrant.. battery life : give almost 1 hour of running time after full charge.. trimmer settings : with all trimmer i have used until now this one gives best zero cut, almost similar as shaving with foam. keeping stubs is also easier as it comes with 3 more combs.. build : this trimmer cum shaver has really good build and comes in good packing.. i would definitely suggest to go for this without any second thought.. be,. krishna singh like: it works as advertised and rather effectively. there are three combs that deliver variances of shaves as close as 5mm, 3mm and 1mm. it is easy to use however an indicator to check when battery is fully charged would have been helpful.. don\\'t like: is quality of the parts like the blade component. my trimmer is not even month old and suffered this breakage. the aftersales support is next to nothing, i understand due to covid-19 scope of services are limited; however acknowledgement of grievances can go long in assuring customers of safe purchase. philips must explicitly mention what is covered under \"warranty\". they hide behind the garb of this term - \"commercially viable\". they mention, they will replace the product or its part if its \"commercially viable\".. conclusion: its a good machine, easy to use but extremely fragile. one has to be very careful, even a slight jerk or a tiny fall may render it useless. mind you, this blade is not cheap it retails at 1899 (during schemes) and 2000 ( without schemes). i would rather have you invest in other brands and more so indian brands which might deliver better quality and good built.. an extremely fragile machine, handle it like a doll. it\\'s really good device, i was skeptical about clean shave but it actually gave clean shave identical to gillette and that too without razor like irritation. however battery life and charging time are major drawback. can\\'t about longevity of blades now but if it\\'s like 4 month as claimed by philips even 3 months also then i would definitely buy again this item was in my wishlist since long and finally made a decision to buy it due to reasons below. 1. not going to office these days and dont need a clean shave :). 2. was looking for an easy to carry razor during my often trip to hometown. writing this review after my 4th shave. i used to shave twice a week using regular razors earlier. things i liked :. 1. compact and handy compared to trimmers. 2. i never expected it to do a clean shave but it does. it does a clean shave if u do it properly, only if you touch you can feel the incompleteness.. 3. it can shave on dry or wet face. 4. a discount coupon was provided in the package with which i could buy 2 additional blades for rs. 800. 5. easy to carry during travel, no need to carry all those supporting stuffs along like cream, brush etc.. things i did not like :. 1. its not economical compared to regular razors, replacement blade is costly. 2. need to shave against the hair growth direction which is not easy as our traditional way, you need to push the razor upward instead of pulling downward.this is very difficult especially chin area.. 3. its never going to be quick as regular razors as you need a close review after shave and rework to remove the remaining hairs. 4. charging 8 hours is too long, you need to remember to charge today if you want to shave tomororw :). also no way to make out if its fully charged or not. 5. clean shave effect is only a day, very next day hair growth is visible. with my regular razors it used to last for atleast 2 days.. 6. makes lot of noise, when u reach near ears you will feel the same grass cutter machine sound:). 7. once i trier dry shave and 3 times with shaving cream, it messes up with the cream though i prefer it, otherwise you may have some allergy pimples here and there. it does not clean the cream on your face unlike a razor, so very difficult to make how clean it shaved. so i recommend to use very little cream or foam.. my conclusion : this is not going to be equivalent to the traditional razors, it may be 80% equivalent if you are using it for clean shave, may be electric shavers are better option even if those cost more. refer some youtube videos for learning the usage properly. they highliflght the problem of cutting skin against the normal razors but i dont think its a real problem for an experienced one. the oneblade is nice and slender, making for an easily maneuverable device that makes all the difference when it comes to precision trimming. oneblade can be used both wet and dry. if you prefer to have your morning shave in the shower, or using shaving gel, the oneblade will happily oblige. plus, cleaning the device is simply a matter of running it under the tap.. this device not only feels easier to use but it won’t block too much of your face when you’re trying to edge up your sideburns either. it’s also possible to shave against the hair without worrying about razor burn. it\\'s good to finally own a shaver and a trimmer as one device! i\\'d definitely recommend giving the oneblade a go. you will not regret it :) i have been using phillips aqua touch. and then i got this.. it\\'s a mistake. it just doesn\\'t work for me perhaps. with just <20 shaves i feel that blade is struggling (battery is fully charged). i will not recommend this. it\\'s actually painful experience with phillips products.. i trust phillips. however, oneblade made me to rethink about brand image i have been carrying. excellent purchase. using the shaver for the past one week and though it takes 2 to 3 minutes longer than mach 3 or other top manual shavers, it does not cut the skin at all. the shaver was fully charged when delivered and till date - from march 9th to 16th 2021 the shaver has not needed recharging. really good.. as advertised it glides over the skin for the closest possible shave, not as close as manual but as close as an electric shaver can so 5 stars for that !. one visual oddity is that the actual head with the blade inside looks extremely small compared to the body of the rest of the shaver. the handle grip is quite thick but the head is really small.. philips can rectify this hopefully in their subsequent models and make the whole unit esthetically pleasing. a larger head will also help in fewer strokes while shaving. also a battery - low light is essential. packaging is transparent and not good. user manual is worthless as you will fumble to use it. once you open the package, don’t expect to use it again. it’s a mess. recharge for 8 hours? you can use it immediately after opening the package for couple of minutes too!. after fumbling and seeing youtube videos as how to put 1mm trimmer on the blade? i succeeded at last and tried to trim my beard. it’s ok to do it. but after few days i tried to shave and the bad news about it is that, if your skin is sensitive and beard hard, then you will have rashes on the face afterwards. so, this thing is only good as a trimmer but not worth your money for use as a shaver. again a great unit by phillips, and i believe this one is a bit better than the traditional shavers there are in the market.. the shaving is comfortable, can be done in both wet and dry. battery is also decent, one charge sails through 5/6 shaves.. the trimming part is something i don\\'t like very much, because the beard length adjuster for trimming are too small. what that means is, there are 3 clips provided to trim your beard to 3 different lengths, and all 3 feel the same to me, and are quite short compared to other trimmers.. so if trimming is what you are looking,buy a trimmer, they are more flexible. for shaver and mild trimming this is great. it\\'s effortless, styles trims & shaves like a charm & looks super cool while doing it ! love the fact that i didn\\'t have to worry about any scratches / itchiness compared to both trimmers & shavers post a grooming session! completely safe as it never touches the skin! awesome that it also has wet and dry capabilities! it feels super premium to hold ! the perfect grooming tool that has ever existed till date! \"one blade to rule them all \" hi all, i bought this product a couple of months back. per usage goes, yes its give close to blade saving when the blade is new !!! there after it is not true. battery life is quite good. with one charge i saved 6 times. now coming to usages perspective - replacement blade is going to kill this product. even they claim one replacement blade lasts upto 4 months is conditional. i used only 5 times in one month and now blade lost its sharpness. to save you have to keep rocking it on your cheek. it is not going to work in india. people would have paid a little bit more money for the product if the blade lasted at least a year. now one replacement blade costing 1000.00 that lasts barely 1 month will not find a way to customers home. that is my 2 star rating. the blade is so smooth and it never cuts you whether you toss it, turn it around your skin.. really good for shaving ... gives a clean shave just like a straight razor from a barber but with no chance of rashes or any in grown hairs.. with my oneblade it\\'s an awesome precision in your hands. ... for now all the custom styles can be done at the comfort of my home with an amazing ease. ... the product glides so smoothly that you hardly feel anything and yet it achieves a perfect finish.. multipurpose easy to use and very adaptable to any type of styling needs . . the battery life is great, one charge can last upto 6-8 trimming sessions or shaves. though i have used it only 1 day but overall i can\\'t complaint much about it.. it comes with installed blade , a blade cover and 3 additional length adjustment ( 5mm, 3 mm and 1 mm respectively). you may also use it without any adjustments just with the naked blade in case you want a clean shave. works well for both dry and wet shaves with minimal effort and a smooth performance.. these there are cons :. 1. the overall output and performance is time tasted.. 2. battery is only for 45 mins and it takes a fortune of 8 hours of charging. quite not what is expected.. 3. the trimmer doesn\\'t come with a led indicator of charing or charge completing indicator nor has a battery level indicator. only the charger has a charding led. quite a deal breaker.. 4. the package should have come with a carrying pouch which the manufacturer doesnot provide and hence creating a chance of losing your attachments.. 5. my trimmer came with a delapitated packaging with minor scratches. i ignored them though.. 6. the additional blades are damn damn expensive. the product is perfect to restore your karmic balance if you believe that in any of your previous lives, you have committed some mistake. the blades are sharp enough to cut butter but that\\'s where the line is drawn. ease of cleaning from a one blade perspective comes into picture only when you actually have to clean it after you\\'ve shaved only a part of your beard and bits and pieces of hair get stuck in the blade, which actually is every single time. since using it i have believed that in a year, i have gained so much positive energy that even my neighbour\\'s next seven generations can live peacefully. highly recommend for karma cleansing.✌ overall a very good product from philips. it is a trimmer cum shaver. it comes with 3 comb options for maintaining 3 different lengths. i use it to trim my beard. does the job for me. i also use it to clean shave my head, yes, i sport a tonsured head. it does an awesome job at it. use it without any of the 3 comb options, to get a clean shave look, it almost gives a clean shave as that of using a razor, minus the cuts a razor can give you.. my only concern with the product is, there is no indicator of the battery life. it says, need a full 8 hour charging, to use it for 45 minutes. with no indicator of how much charge is left in the battery, it becomes difficult to know the charge left. it would be better for philips to add that feature at least in the next version of the product. recommended as an occasional trimmer only. pretty useless if you’re using this as a shaver. since you go against the grain, you will only end up with in-growing hair and the resultant pimples, as well as some cuts. i’m back to using my razor after two months of using the oneblade system - i ended up with pimples/boils all over my neck where is the skin is thin, these were gone in a few weeks of returning to the razor. pretty fragile, slow to charge and easy to lose the really small trimmer combs. this is a good product from phillips. the design makes it easy to clean because of the different blade head. however the same blade head is difficult to use on contours because it is angled in an odd direction.. the blades are sufficiently sharp and have stayed sharp over about 2 months of usage. the accessories are somewhat basic compared to what you get in the other trimmers but it is adequate for me since i barely use them anyways.. the battery life is also good, with one overnight charge lasting 3-4 shaves on average. the product is flashy in its mint green color and rubbery patterned grip. - battery life is alright, will last for a few full beard trims. - the blade life is really poor. i replaced my first after a few months (5-8) trims maybe. i had medium stubble, never grown to a thick beard in all these trims. so people with a thick beard, forget about this.. - the tip is washable , but cleaning is pain have used alot of trimmer as they never lasted for a long, had to replace almost after 5-6 months. but started using philips 6 years back and the products are too good. i have a trimmer and a shaver using trimmer from more than 6 years and it\\'s perfectly fine and didn\\'t even take it for service as good as new. shaver is also almost 5 years old, but it accidentally fell and the top break so with 0 doubt ordered this, new in market.. the product is not doubt awsmm. the finess of the philips is the key, they actually last long and have no issues, at least with me. the shaver works with a great clean output and it has no tension give cut marks. i can use it randomly in any direction and it has prefect clean. the battery life is also good, used it 3 times and i think can do couple of more shaves to. the grip of the trimmer is good and it feels more firm now and light weight, so even if it falls, i guess will survive.. i recommend this and it is great product just go for it. philips is the brand and people who are using all of them live it. the product quality is good but it is very bad to use and clean also in 4 months you have to buy a new blade and by purchasing two blades you can and easy a fort and another new trimmer so so don\\'t buy it. worst experience, battery life is not good and trimmer blade is worst too, my suggestion guys i am reviewing this product after 3 months.... that when i purchased 1st month was great after that while trimme it suddenly get off.don\\'t waist your money 💰 on this product update - the charger given to me is very different from the original. saw this very late. now stuck with this trimmer that can\\'t be charged so is useless to me now. bad luck i saw it only recently as there was enough charge when i got it... looking for the charger only now.... this is such a awesome trimmer. the package consists of everything that you may need for trimmimg. the brand is also philips so it\\'s a great product. the battery life is also pretty good. very happy with my purchase damaged product was delivered. tried replacing it. even the replaced one is damaged. blades are very delicate and not durabale. dont waste your money by buying it. if you are lucky you will get a good one. else youroney will be waste. more than 50% of the money spent on it might have gone for thier ads and not on the way they made it.. the light on the device stopped working when charging it for the very second usage.. those clips provided are not properly designed.. i highly doubt that it can resist water, and so dont want to expirement on that.. just have to protect it safely instead of using it the way they show it on tv or any media, count on for every time i use comparing it with the cost at local saloon.. just caring for the money spent. i am using this for almost a month now and below are my feedback.. - i am 100% sure that either this is a duplicate product or a good for nothing product from philips !!. - you can\\'t use this item either for shaving or trimming purpose !. - for this price , you get many better products outside if the quality offered by philips is just this .. totally dissatisfied with this product !!! this is one of the best products i could find online, i hv been using this product for over 6 months now but, the shaving is super clean, the additional connectors provided for trimming do a good job. i was surprised with the battery life as in january i was out for 15 days due to my work and i shave everyday, i had forgotten the charger which i had kept to charge the shaver 100% at home. the shaver easily lasted for a month even after i got back, had to charge after a month. but yes to use this product we hv to get used to the way we twist and turn the blades on our face. no doubt philips providing a good range of this kind of products and i\\'m big fan of philips trimmers it\\'s my 3rd product but after using 2 month\\'s it\\'s blade performance is going low and u can\\'t use it both side to move in the trimmer and now i got some major issues like over heating and it\\'s turn off sudden when u trimming not fully satisfied philips nova is much better i have read ..many customers are said about costing issues about the blade. but according to my review changing blade is not a issue. we use water filters and we change candles accordingly. so why we have issues with changing blades.. this blade is a very excellent blade which gives a razor like shave even in 0 trimming setting . so costing in this blade is not a issue according to me.. the investment in this trimmer is always wise. because philips the company of netherlands never cheats you.. the service of amazon is not good, its best. ordered my second every trimer and this time too it\\'s philips.. one blade as the name suggest is perfect for all beard grooming needs.. comes with handle, one blade, 3 combs, 1 blade cover and a charger.. works great for timing, don\\'t expect super clean shave as shaving blade but fair enough for invisible beard shave with just the blade on.. blade and comb clips and detaches properly and works well in water too.. over all, it\\'s a good trimer. worth a buy. amazing product from gilette. neglect the negative reviews. this is by far one of the best products from gilette. shave is as clean as you can get without a blade conventional razor. surely the affair is a costly one and you may need to buy a replacement blade every 10 weeks. depends on how frequently you shave. if you shave everyday, then assume 12 to 14 weeks for sure. battery is good. it takes time to charge but if that bothers you, go for its higher model. it\\'s not as good as a clean shave, but it\\'s really close. especially when you let your facial hair grow, this very easily mows through all the hair. it\\'s completely painless. i just wish there was some compartment which collects the cut hair. right now, you have to manually remove hair that has accumulated near the blade, which means you can\\'t use this on your sofa or your desk, you have to be in the bathroom so that you can wash off the hair frequently. i\\'m very much satisfied with the product though it doesn\\'t give you clean shave like manual razor blade or wet shave but it gets the job done battery life is good to my expectations now when it comes to trimming it does a very good job but if you\\'re looking for clean shave then forget it it\\'ll give you clean look but it doesn\\'t touch skin good for skin sensitive people blades are high quality very durable product for my usage i\\'m very much enjoying it with wet shave i had too much of pimple problem but with this no problem at all buy it if you\\'re looking for clean look but not like baby face look. it really gives 0.2 level of cut. so better then any available trimmer out there.. we have some attachments for trimming at different level like 1,3,5,. but this all is very delicate its not sturdy. for long run i don\\'t expect it to last like other trimmers. u cannot charge and use it at same time. need to charge then after that you can use it. blades are replaceable which is good. but need to spend money every three months. i thought it\\'s a 3 in 1 product, but it is essentially a trimmer only. if you are thinking of replacing your regular manual shaving blade or razor with this, then you will be disappointed. it takes more time to shave with this and that too you won\\'t get a clean shave.. as far as trimming is concerned, it does a decent job. but there are trimmers with better attachments and much cheaper cost than this one.. in my opinion, this is an over-priced and over-hyped trimmer. it\\'s effortless, styles trims & shaves like a charm & looks super cool while doing it !. love the fact that i didn\\'t have to worry about any scratches / itchiness compared to both trimmers & shavers post a grooming session!. completely safe as it never touches the skin! awesome that it also has wet and dry capabilities!. it feels super premium to hold ! the perfect grooming tool that has ever existed till date!. \"one blade to rule them all \" i have used this product over 3 months now. build quality. the build quality of this product is not so great feels bit fragile so don\\'t drop it.. the blade. if you are using it instead of trimmer , then you wont be using it daily i guess and the blade will last at least 4-6 months. but if you are using it daily as then the blade wont last long (maybe a month or 2) in that case its better to use razor.. also dullness of the blade will depend on the type of your beard hair. thicker the beard hair = more replacement blades in an year.. the main advantage of this over a trimmer is that it gives you cleaner cut/trim than your regular trimmer. it’s just a fine trimmer, and not a shaver as claimed.. i moved from my aqua touch to one blade but did not like it from the first day.. multiple runs up and down will trim the hair down very minute, but it won’t be a clean shave.. biggest let down, the replacement blade is costing half the price of a new one.. the blade is very flimsy and surely this is a product to be avoided.. don’t fall in trap of a shaver, at best this is a trimmer. only after 15 days of use the blade has broken. and philips had told me that they are not responsible for any physical damage. come on bro it’s only 15 days. and you can clearly see in one of photos the have stated 2 years world wide guarantee. so i would like to suggest you not to buy this third class item. you can imagine it’s build quality by my experience. highly intelligent product with logic . i am quite happy and assure zero percent irritation on your skin .. a good purchase , though unfortunately unknown about these big billion festival offers i ordered one day before .. i paid 100 rupees extra ! for that reason i went to angry mode .. with out looking or review the new innovation. later i realized .. and after using it .. i feel extremely comfortable and happy .. just fantastic 😍 .. go for it .. but telling you .. it takes time to get used to and adapt. don\\'t know why everyone has given negative rating. but according to me it does what it is asked to do. have used it as wet with foam and dry both ways it works good and gives clean shave. i have been using triple blade of gillette manual shaver and philips dry shaver with rotatory blades.. if one has used the rotary blades shaver then it is easy to use. don\\'t use as deep blades as used in manual blades. very good product to trim long beard hair. don\\'t expect it to give you a shave as close as razor as it clearly states that it won\\'t. if you want a close shave then foil type shaver is a much better option. i use both of them. phillips to shave long hair as close as possible and braun foil shaver to finish off to give it a shave as close to a shave with razor. if you have sensitive skin and are prone to skin burn while shaving then go for it and combine it with a foil type shaver. very poor battery backup. discharges very fast. no indication of battery percentage, you have to charge on your judgement. bought this only due to lockdown as salons were closed. btw good for hair removal on body; chest , armpits and abdominals. one blade is not a misleading name for this or we can say ironic name because you need to buy it blade as you buy razor blades.. battery life i\\'m not sure but till now it never stopped in middle of a trim or shave but the problem is the indication in the charger never get off even after charging more than 12hr. if you buy make sure charge not more than 12hr even the light is not get off. easy to clean and use but handle with care the blade head is so fragile . never keep with the timer. take it out of the time and cap it and keep it in a safe box and only put while using. don\\'t change the blade every 6months as the say. use untill it pulling ur hair. philips oneblade is a very good combination of trimmer and shaver and might seems the best option in market. but don\\'t fall for their advertisement, it\\'s literally pain in ass. it can be used as a trimmer efficiently, at most, but as a potent shaver - not at all.. 1. advertisement says at can give wet and dry shaves, whereas actually it\\'s good for only dry shave, wet/foam shave doesn\\'t work well. can not be recommended for a daily shaver.. 2. blades doesn\\'t seem sharp enough, a little tug is experienced even for new blade.. 3. blades wear out fast, for example, if you shave daily, blades wear out in just 2-2½ months. after that, one has to replace blades.. 4. the most annoying factor, battery life. it\\'s the only thing what they show in advertisement which is true - one has to charge oneblade for around 10 hrs for 45-50 minutes of usage.. what i think is why not buy a dedicated shaver by philips than buying oneblade! it\\'s definitely better & give a closer shave. when i received this product, it comes in unique packaging from philips. on opening it, i got a lime green nice looking trimmer. most lovable part about this trimmer is that you dont need to change its blade for style, trim and shave. so whenever i need it for any purpose , i use it without any worry. i never had great experience with trimmer. but till i got this trimmer, my all problems were solve. as it have long lasting rechargeable battery which can run for 45 minutes, as i am travelling alot due to work so i found it more useful. as i told i worried about using trimmer as they can cut sometime your skin, but its dual protection system has a protective plate on top of the cutter which preventing the blade from touching skin. no trimmer i found which can shave with foam, but i use this trimmer with foam too,. was thinking a lot to buy this instead of blades.. i have been shaving for the past 20 years and really tired of using foam and blade and aftershave and during travels its bit messy! however, after buying this stopped buying blades and after 10 shaves the blade remain intact. important thing is you will need to practice slowly so that you become perfect in using this. accidental slips might cause damage to hair and blade. it survived a 5 feet drop on the bottom and blade was fine. i have a very rough and reverse beard under neck. it easily removes everything.. thanks philips! after using it for just one month my blade started to switch the color and now i cannot cut hair as smooth as the new blade. and the replacement blade is rs.849/- which is too costly to get a new each month.. this is just a trimmer, it cannot replace the original razer.. battery doesn\\'t last longer than 30 minutes.. i will not recommend this to anyone. it\\'s just a waste of money just get it!!! it s the best i have used soo far in the trimming range.. ofcourse its not a shaver but it gives you a very clean shave.. its flawless blade guides very easily without any itch. its the best one phillips has ever created. it is a very good product by philips. the delivery was seamless and on time.. key points of product are:-. 1. it’s very easy to use, the body is so ergonomic and user friendly.. 2. it cleans the beard and hairs in face flawlessly.. 3. there are no chances of cut and damage to your skin.. 4. it gives approx 40 minutes of use time after a single full charge.. 5. water resistant body and blade design.. cons:-. the blade is exhausted in 4 months and a new blade costs rs.600/- this one balde is trimmer cum shaver, it gives nice shave. for trimming there are limitations. this trimmer is most costliest trimmer as you have to change its blade after 4 months of conditional usage, which will cost you rs. 750/-. my blade has already started showing signs of replacement after 10 12 shaves. also remember you cannot return this item. i will advice you to buy regular trimmer. your product does not work same as a new one after a ten days. for some reason, it is pulling hair and causing a lot of pain during usage. i’ve used the same product multiple times and ordered it via amazon two times in last two months. it has stopped working smoothly after every first ten days of use.. i strongly recommend to check your inventory to make sure it’s legitimate product via philips as i’ve used this product before too. strongly suggest not to buy this. before buying this product i was confused about what if it don’t fulfil the task of a trimmer. i have always been using a trimmer for mu beard grooming. i read reviews saying this product is not that great. but personally found this to be excellent i terms of shaving. it clears the hairs from the skin do clean. also when used as a trimmer, it does its task completely. though the number of attachments for trimming purpose are limited to 1mm, 3mm and 5 mm but this product will not disappoint you. trimmers are legacy but this oneblade is the future. i really appreciate the idea of the trimmer performing the work of a shaving blade.. the cost of the trimmer is 1300 during sale, and 1900 during normal days. the cost of a blade is around 700 to 800 which is half of the trimmer cost. come on... really ?. for those who are really thinking if you can shape your beard like how they show in the video.. 1. you need to be really good at judging both the sides of your cheeks to shape it and this trimmer cannot do that magic. most of the time i end up adjusting left and right and finally end up shaving entire cheeks. lol ..... 2. even for soft beard the blade doesnt last well. it gets blunt very soon.. final verdict: its better to carry a shaving razor for shaping and use a regular philips trimmer to cut with the required height 1mm,3mm,5mm beautiful and functional design. it looks good just sitting there on your basin or washroom cabinet. try not to drop it though. much more aesthetic than other bulkier, clunkier trimmers flooding the market. top marks to philips for the design bit (not function though). avoid if you are looking for something that does its job well day after day. you will have fun for the initial few days. i used it for shaving and first 8-10 shaves were pretty decent (with and without foam). the problem is that you expect the quality of blades to go down gradually, as it would happen with any blade; however this one just drops like a dead body. you would have to literally rub it into your face to get a decent shave later.. plug it in for a good 6-8 hours if you want the motor to purrr for 2-3 shaves (not more than that). go for it only if the cost of the blades doesn\\'t bother you much. used product. zoom the image and you can see hair strands in the blade. product package arrived open, quite obvious. furious on how cheap this can get.. this review is solely for the seller and not for the product. it has so many features but what i like most is the feather touch trim. very convinient to use one blade for trim, style and shave unlike my previous trimmer which needed to change the blades for each purpose. also the battery life is amazing, i have charged it once as of now and already used it for trimming twice and it still can be used atleast for 2 more trims. overall it gives a very clean and precised look with a very comfortable use. it can be used both dry and wet. its amazing product ever i had very flexible to use very light weight nice to recharge it superb design the product is as good as it is described, the 1st shave i had without a foam or gel, didn\\'t feel the pinch & it was a great shave as ever with a something like that. good handling & nicely balanced one. let\\'s hope this continues further, because this is my 1st time shave with the product. will be updating after some time. overall a good concept..but when it comes to the practical application of this product on a daily use...i don\\'t think it would last you more than a month or so....easy to use, comfortable to handle, smooth shave almost like clean, great battery backup only worry is it\\'s not going to last for long and it\\'s not a self sharpening blade technology and the blade cost you half the price of the product... this philips hand held electric trimmer is a delight to use. overall, i am pretty happy its performance in regards to the cutting or trimming of smallest and softest hair as well. the only downside is that you have to replace the blade within 15 times of usage and that costs a bomb. you can use to shape, cut, trim any or every part of the body with relative ease. i am writing this feedback after using it for more than 6 months, and believe me this is the best trimmer or sleek shaver out there. the blade wil not last long..replacement blades is very expensive not really fits the concept if we need to buy such expensive blades... this is the second piece i have purchased again , since one earlier i had bought from us was broken , have been using it since 2.5 years, and the day i used it for the first time was the last time i used razor , till today it\\'s philips neo in case i consider shaving. use it wet , dry , foam no foam , it works, the shave is not a clean shave like razor, but its the closest thing to that. earlier i was using aqua touch range of shavers from phillips. they were better in terms of clean shave compared to the current product. but biggest negative for aqua touch range was it would over time make your beard curly/whirly/circular and requires much more effort.. current philips shaver is better in terms of user effort and keeping beard straight. but -ve points are battery life and not so clean shave. if a product is priced this much users would expect much better product and much better battery life. phillips should work on these aspect. i use this to shape my beard. may be gives near close to clean shave.. battery is amazing as upto a month and still.... never charged the damn thing. needed something for close stubble shaping as timmers cant go as close and the plain shaving blades don\\'t work well without foam. very pleased to say that this one doesn\\'t leave any rashes and it\\'s very precise to get the shape you want. the battery is good and it doesn\\'t sound as loud as other trimmers and i am quite happy with its performance. although i wish it had an extra blade in the packaging or the blade cost would be cheaper, it doesn\\'t wear off easily with my light use and should last a long time better than gillette fusion for sure. i have a gillette fusion and this one is way better than that firstly because it has a simple 1 blade technology and you don’t have any cuts and nicks as the design prevents the blade coming into direct contact with your skin.. secondly the design principle requires you to save against the grain which gives the closest shave possible without any irritation. this can also be used to save any kind of unwanted body hair. battery life is also pretty decent, lost easily up to 3 to 4 shaves. initial impressions, since i have only used this a few days. performs very nicely as a trimmer, great precision and much less noisy than my existing trimmer. however shave quality is inferior to my electric shaver, so far behind a regular razor. no idea yet on blade life, and replacements are not cheap. looks like this product makes sense only if requirements are for a trimmer alone different product. shaves very fine and clean. i need not use razor for shaving. no need for shaving foam or cream. just do it in plain skin. no skin irritation. soft on skin. trims hair in just one stroke. easy to use in difficult areas of neck too. fine and fast blade movement. overall it’s amazing. i always use philips trimmer. my last one is three year old but still working fine. i bought this to try it. it’s very fine. worth the spend. wow! works like a charm. made in indonesia. excellent finish and feel. super results with beard shaped like a pro. i\\'ve been using trimmers since 10 yrs now. this one is the best. only con for me is that it doesn\\'t support beyond 5 mm beard. i use a 12mm on the chin which would have made this a perfect buy for me. now i am using two trimmers. one blade for shaping and another philips trimmer for trimming. overall it is a very good product for men. below are my review after the usage of philips one blade.. pros:. 1. very easy to use, light weight. nice ergonomic design.. 2. very precise and sharp blades for styling and smooth shaving.. 3. protective layer over the blade for protecting any accidental cuts.. 4. overall a fantastic product.. cons:. 1. after a charging of 8 hours it only lasts up to 40 mins approximately. battery life could have been better.. 2. as per philips blade life is approximately 4 months. and the cost of a blade is almost inr 800, which is very much on the higher side. additional one blade could have been included in the pack. the blade is totally not worth it. for the clean shave, you may have repeat it 5 to 6 times in the same spot. i frequently use the philip brand and in fact i still have the old one which worked for more than 2 yrs and even the only problem is that i am unable to charge it. this new is totally a disaster. pls dont buy this. handsome looks, very handy, ergonomic, very much useful for trimming,shaving .overall recommended for all males to have one otherwise men with beard will be missing. very smooth trim , no irritating, lovely i personally loved the product... it hasn\\'t been marketed properly.. wish there was a lil faster charging also option of micro usb charging.. 🔋life is good. quality of build is nice and super easy to clean.. important point- i found the best way to get an even trim or shave is to wet the face slightly...hair doesn\\'t fly everywhere and blade stays cooler. no need of foam unless you finishing off the last can from your gillette shaving days lol hi all!!!!!!. its an amazing shaver cum trimmer....... it can work as a trimmer as well as shaver... you can do dry shaving or wet shaving by it.. the best part is it comes with 3 different combs i. e. 1mm 3mm 5mm, you can use any of them for your trimming purpose.. it provides you a blade like shave... and thats amazing. and you can use single blade for 4 months.. that\\'s awesome i gifted this to my husband thinking about his skin irritation after every shave. this has worked well for him and there is no skin irritation after shave but the battery discharge is quick and one needs to charge it every single time before use. it’s helpful while trimming or shaving but the fine finish lacks. overall it’s a good buy but needs improvements. the all star - philips one blade trimmer - beats all the products in the industry,. first things first, product has aesthetics and sturdy feel while holding.. when using, the twin blades saves a lot of time, which is fast and easy and on the skin, giving a perfect look with best egde work. the subtle combs are perfect for the different occassional looks one desires.. the battery life is great, one charge can last upto 6-8 trimming sessions or shaves.. a great buy and worth every dime. this is the best trimmer i have come across with all the philips trimmer range. as attached in the image the kit comes with charger and three variant of combs. as the rajor doesn\\'t have any mode option it has three different comb option to set the level of trimm.. it charges super fast and has a great battery life. very easy to use, very light weight and handy. it will not take much of your space. refer to the images to have a close look on what comes in the box. i can see the rating of this product is 4.2/5. but i got a defected piece. usually whatever things i order from amazon are good and i don\\'t get any problem, but this trimmer is like hell. i have been using it from last six months and whenever i use it, it creates some or the other problems.. first of all, the battery of this trimmer was very bad. it takes around 8 hours to get fully charged, and after charging that much, it doesn\\'t even work for 20 minutes. also, there was no indication about battery getting low, and if try to use it while plugging its charger in, then also it doesn\\'t work.. i don\\'t want to comment anything on amazon and phillips, because both are great brands. but i am very unlucky to have this defected product. overall i liked the unit. but the blade unit is very fragile.. i am not a rough user, but with my second shave, the blade got disconnected with the electrical unit.. the blade is pretty expensive, hence this has to be sturdy.. not sure if there is a replacement option for this.. i liked the other aspects that it is pretty simple to use and is comfortable on the hand.. if the blade is gone, there is nothing left. that\\'s the problem. if you are a trimmer user, blindly replace your existing product and buy this. if you are not a trimmer user, you should still buy it.. its a fabulous product. very smooth against skin, you may press it hard against your cheek and still it won\\'t bruise your skin. trims hair perfectly. excellent battery life.. just go for it! unless your hair is thin and soft, it cannot be treated as a shaver. but still, it is one of the best trimmers i have ever used. the cost of replacement blades is very high, though. this is the best phillip trimmer till date. it’s easy to use and the sleek design is comfortable while using. it isn’t like other trimmers which are rough on face and the precision is too good. you don’t need to shave after use for a clean look, this has borderline clean shave results. though they should give a trimmer brush to clean it. this is the best trimmer i have ever used. i used trimmer before but never got the clean shave trim from them as they could not give that close cut like a razor/shaver. and using a shaver/razor everyday is not possible as it takes time by using shaving cream and possibility of cuts are always there. this is actually a revolutionary product, it has given me a clean shave like a razor/shaver with the convenience of trimmer. a perfect product from philips, worth every rupee spent. pros: good style, color and slim structure.. cons: very flimsy. close shave possible only with too many repeats. as a trimmer only useful for short hair. with a little longer hair the comb does not catch the hair. much suitable for trimming mustache. the blade set comes of from the handle even while removing the comb/protective cover. the lock button does not hold the blade set securely.. conclusion: cannot be perceived as a philips product. finally i have a winner!!! i\\'ve tried a wide range of brands before this starting from cheap ones like nova to the so called royals ustraa but, i can finally stop trying more cause now i have a winner!!! this gives closest and smoothest shave then any others, a must buy product. last week, i received my philips oneblade trimmer and i couldn\\'t stop me to use it. my experience with this is good, though i feel that i would have been a better product. easy to use and handle but little tough to use it over jawline. product is light weight so you feel comfortable to handle it even for some long. i am waiting to see how it\\'s life indicator works. i came to know that the replacement blade costs more than rs 800, which is quite expensive. well, let\\'s see when it lasts so that i can decide whether to buy replacement blades or not. 👍 the product is over all excellent, does not hurt while shaving, and even can remove hair from your ears better than the nose and ear hair removers. however, when you buy the product, they hide the fact that the blade needs be be changed (quite often based on usage), and that the cost of additional blades is expensive. and their blade offer seems impossible to redeem!!!. wake up phillips, or your competitor will. philipps always produces great quality of products and this time they failed miserably with onblade. there are too many problems with oneblade.. i would not suggest and dont waste your money. 1. not at all can be used for close shave..you will get bored trying to run again and again...then you will use your razors. 2. quite low powered ..get stuck sometime and not able to cut the hair..never gives you close shave. 3. needs constant charging...shaky blade it\\'s been a week since i\\'m using these product now and i\\'ve never had such smooth and comfortable shaving experience till now. the blades are flexible & super safe to use without attachments and gives a very clean look after using. the speed is also quite good. it has blades on both upper and lower side which i liked the most. battery life is also quite good. the only con is that you\\'ll have to replace the blade after every 4 months and it\\'s too expensive.overall, i loved the product. i would give a thumbs up! i used to have a geepas trimmer which when used gave me a lot of pain. but oneblade is so good. it is easy to use and is water resistant. i love it. but you need to shave atleast twice on the same spot for a good finishing.. also you need to charge 8 hrs for 45 mins runtime. it\\'s okay. just keep in mind that the replacement blades are expensive (rs. 850 each). but if you\\'re buying from philips website for the first time they\\'ll give you a 50% offer.. i recommend you to buy it as it also comes with 2 yrs warranty. i have primarily used this product for trimming and shaping my beard. it works well.. hair can be trimmed down to 3mm and 5mm with the help of attachments. cleaning it is fairly easy.. the product mimics the shape of a razor blade and can be used from both ends although if you are using the attachments then it can be used only from one side. i had to think multiple times before placing the order, after seeing all the reviews, but after using it i don\\'t regret. this was the device i was looking for.. only few mandatory improvements which will make the product best in the market.. 1. charging indicator should be on the device, not on the adaptor with a color indications.. 2. it should also used while plugged in. corded usage, or there should be an auto cut of power when fully charged, since the design of the trimmer takes little longer time to finish the work with care.. rest....after few more usage. this device comes with 1 blade, this whole item costs ~1.9k₹. the blade has to be changed after ~3 months. pack of 2 blades costs ~4.8k₹ while pack of 3 costs ~6.6k₹.. either ithis wasn\\'t mentioned properly or i may have missed it.. however goodor bad the product may be this fact makes it useless.. although the prices of blades may be affected due to post-lockdown and pandemic.. my other phillips body grooming shaver/trimmer doesn\\'t require replacement. it is very good trimmer replacement. after using this you don\\'t need the trimmer as it does the work more perfectly. you can even have a near perfect shave with it without using shaving gel or cream.. the battery too lasts good and the blade would last easily 5-6 months on normal usage.. would recommend everyone as a replacement to trimmer. the trimmer head broken. i have tried making attempts to get the product replace however inspite of the product being under warranty, i am asked by the local repair centre to pay damages of inr 1200 to get the product replaced where as i was told by the amazon tele executive that i don\\'t need to pay anything for replacement. i feel so cheated that would like to file a consumer complaint.. please help.. regards very poor performance. don\\'t get this product. i bought it two weeks back but i used it only twice i e. on the day when i got the delivery and yesterday. but let alone shaving it doesn\\'t trim and the blade is not sharp the blade comes off from the trimmer body. and upon contacting customer care i was told that they\\'ll send someone to my home to repair the trimmer but the next day i get a call saying that i\\'ve to visit the dealer to get it repaired which is not advisable in the period of covid-19. also they say the blade is not covered under warranty so i\\'ve to buy the blade. why should i buy the blade if i\\'ve not used it even for two days. really appreciate the quality of the trimmer. this philips trimmer has met my expectations more... the trimmer was more than i thought it to be. i can give really good shapes to my beard and smooth finishing ...makes my face look clean.. no patch work. easily usable and quick start and no large noises... the make of the trimmer is so elegant. battery wise it could have had better run time but it is ok so battery really not an issue. takes 6-8 hours to completely charge. overall a nice set of trimmer with good blades. good for trimming / shaving small beard.. not suitable for grooming of large beard.. and battery performance depends on individual usage but overall good battery performance.. blade is okay for normal skin but can be more smoother.. however have to replace blade after a time period.. charger has indicator but trimmer doesn\\'t have any indicator if charging is full or empty.. cleanliness is not simple as cleaning brush, cloth etc not provided with trimmer. does not work as advertised / expected. it leaves an uneven trim, takes too long to handle thick stubble and is difficult to use. there is no value in going for this compared to a regular trimmer, whose blade lasts for 2 to 3 years. this requires balde to be replaced every 4 months and you don\\'t get any additional benefit except that you can hold and use it like a regular shaving razor. this is a waste of money. i liked how the blades clean the beard but its blades are stucking after 20th use.. its blades lost its sharpness and power of cutting very soon and as it is very expensive trimmer then it is not expected that the blades go useless very early.. when i bought this device after 20th shave i am not able to use it.. either i will have to buy another blade which i am not gonna buy because it lefts its sharpness very early.. whenever i see its advertisement i regret of buying and spending my money on this.. no doubt the tech in this is good but blader are not long lasting andvery costly to change. this is like whole other experience. i\\'ve used the the most popular 1200 rs one famous trimmer for almost 2 years and this is like something else. it trims without any resistance or vibration that you feel on skin. blade works both ways and is super light with washable design. battery life is great too. a really worthy product. i have had my fair share of razor burns and cuts from cartridge razors.. so i used the old philips bt1000 trimmer since the last 5 years and was more or less satisfied but the trimming almost always left a stubble behind.. bought this new philips one blade and i am surprised at the results. the shave is more than close than i first hoped for. tried on wet and dry and liked the results on both. does need 2-3 passing for the optimum results though. tbh it has surpassed my expectations since my skin is very sensitive and i can do away with an almost perfect shave. :). the trick is to go against the grain. the price is a bit on the higher side, but if you have sensitive skin, a decent budget and are on the edge of buying it or not, just go for it. it\\'s neither good not bad. however it\\'s very handy and convinient if you are stuck in circumstance like in lockdown and no salons are open thus giving 4.. it just gives a visible smoothness which lasts like 2 days, however no matter how much you try it\\'ll not smooth on touch.. battery is really good. lasts 4-5 shaves i find it very difficult to use , it takes 3 times more time to trim...not recommended at all this trimmer is truly amazing and works great. trims every hair finely and makes the skin smooth and looks good. it is very easy to use and has to be charged. once you charge it full it\\'s can be used more than a week. so you can use is for many days in only one charging. you can carry it with yourself for tours and long travellings and it can act as a saviour for you outside . overall at this price it is an amazing product. this is the pro when it comes to men\\'s grooming... best in market now, it\\'s a tough competitor to beat.. coz its unique. so let\\'s get down to the. pros & cons.. pros :. * dual-sided blade for comfort. * precision trimming & styling. * close shave with no skin irritations thanks to protective plate. * amazing battery life. * a cap is provided for protection of the blade .also you and remove the blade and keep it safe.. * wet & dry use. * easy to clean.. cons :. * charging wire is short (10 - 20 cm more length would be nice ). * no usb type charging or fast charging. * replacement blades are costly & bit fragile. * some face parts are difficult to trim like the side burns. you can\\'t do it properly as you do with the older philip trimmer like the qg3250 may be that\\'s a sacrifice..😀. so that\\'s all folks ... it\\'s the best !! it’s a worthless piece of crap!!!. the razor will last less than 10 shaves.. the price of single razor is around rs. 800, which means every shave will cost u around the 100 bucks.. moreover after 6-8 shave the razor gives up which consumes more battery power.. trust me after 6 to 8 shave u will not like to use it. worst product in terms of longitivity. the blade is not durable. it could be easily broken from its joints even with accidentally fall from your hand. i have hardly used philips one blade for couple of times and now i can\\'t use it unless i brought new blade. the blade is quite expensive around 900 inr per blade. so i would not recommend this product. i have used this philips trimmer for 2 weeks and experienced this serious issues:. 1. it is provided with different size clipper set but it is useless because when you are actually using it does not get fit properly and gets falls off when you are actually trimming.. 2. the hairs gets stuck in the cliper set it self, so you need to remove and clean then use. this procedure needs to be repeated all the time.. 3.philips trimmer battery is dead after some time but this model does not work with direct corded , it works only on battery, so no expectation for a long run. this product is just made to make money, the blades cost too much. it feels smooth while trimming but took too many strokes to get a clean trim. cleaning the blades feel like hell. it doesn\\'t have usb charging instead they give an adapter. it\\'s more comfortable with usb as u don\\'t have to carry a seperate adapter for your mobile and the trimmer. no indication led on the trimmer. the size adjustable heads are of worst quality and may brake after some use. there are better trimmers under 1k if price is taken care. the trimmer is beautifully designed to give the beard a perfect shape.it is nicely built as well so as to have a perfect grip on it.the trimmer has a replacable blade provided with it.it becomes full charged in approx an hour and can easily give you a backup of hour,hour and a half .the accessories,i.e. the trimming combs,are of excellent quality.the hold of the combs on the trimmer is good as well and it doesn\\'t shake off due to locking mechanism of the trimmer.the blades of the trimmer are very gentle on the skin and don\\'t lead to any kind of itching on the skin.with the help of the combs,the trimming can be ranged from 0-5 mm very precisely.an overall beast of a trimmer that boasts of some quality features. this philips trimmer is a strong built trimmer for an easy shave and provides many different combs also for trimming of different types of style that you want to keep for the day/week. the smooth shave also helps in faster shave as it has a good quality blade and another pro thing is that you can use it while in the shower also. that is an added advantage, the battery life of the trimmer is also very good as it keeps it charged for a longer time. the blade needs to be changed after 6 months. finally i have the solution i always wanted to have. i have a thick growth of beard, earlier shaving every two days was must for me. i really hoped for some option that can help me groom and trim the beard. this one is so perfect, it trims as close as to shave! worth the money! you can go for it if u r seeking something for daily use, trim and grooming.. i really liked the philips oneblade. it has consistent performance which rivals corded trimmers – it truly is a remarkable device. it is very efficient due to its revolutionary design. a single charge is enough for a full shave or trim which shows a good battery life. very smooth and effortless shave. very convenient for travel as it has a very ergonomic design. the best cordless device on the market right now. it is water resistant and can be used in the shower. really enjoyed shaving with it. a must buy!!!! are you looking for face trimmer+shaver with excellent built quality, great battery life, a showerproof construction, something that is travel friendly and looks great while doing all of the above?. if yes, i suggest you consider the \\'philips oneblade hybrid trimmer & shaver- qp2525/10\\'. product-. this is a hybrid ‘trimmer & shaver’ from one of the reputed and reliable brands in the market- philips.. as the name suggests, this device can be used for trimming facing hair as well as providing a shaving experience.. it has a unique blade construction- blades on the top and bottom rows with a protective plate that helps you go either way on the face (towards and against the grain).. and given the small form factor & effective features, it can substitute your manual razor in case of travel or a quick shave.. features-. • the trimmer comes in compact body form which is good for travel. even the bundled wall charger is compact. • robust build quality and with a premium feel. • lime and dark gray color combination. • rubberized grips on both sides to prevent slips. • ipx 7 rating (showerproof) that makes it apt for wet & dry use. • great battery life. • unique blade unit that has blades on the top and bottom rows that aid in a proper shaving experience. • 3 attachment combs for trimming- 1mm, 3mm, 5mm. usage experience-. * always read the manual before before using your product. it helps you to use the product in the right way intended, enriching your experience and help you to maintain your product for longevity.. using this unit is a treat, especially when i require a quick shave. the blades didn’t cause irritation or redness on my skin due to the presence of a small lime colored protection layer on either edges of the blade, thus preventing extreme contact between the blade and skin. and the fact that blade unit has blades on the top and bottom rows helps a lot to achieve a minute shave. the same can be used to fine trim and style the mustache and the beard.. the unit feels solid and its compactness is appreciated. plus, it is an ipx 7 rated unit making it showerproof, which gives a certain peace of mind even when used wet.. the battery is another aspect i loved about this unit. there wasn’t an instance where i ran out of battery in middle of a shave, even when i used it right out of the box.. it also comes with good quality locking combs and a blade housing to protect the blade during travel or storage.. lastly, the ability of the company to provide the unit and its accessories in compact package is well though of. be it the unit, the blade, wall charging unit- all of them pack small which is great for travel.. my shaving patterns are similar to those recommended by philips on the package (2 full shaves per week). so i feel the blade unit should last me as stated i.e. 4 months. and like most philips products, it a well built unit and should last one for a long time.. additional tips-. always wash your face with warm water and a face wash before trimming or shaving. pat dry when using an electric trimmer.. this clear dirt and excess oils on your skin and moisturizes the hair to be shaved.. the warm water helps in softening the follicles which help the pores to open up, making for a closer shave.. and always try shaving after a shower/ bath as the it helps the hair to absorb water from the shower, aiding in a smoother shave.. packing-. it comes in a plastic see through casing that holds. • the trimmer unit. • the blade. • the blade housing (to protect during travel and storage). • wall charging charging unit. • attachment combs- 1mm, 3mm, 5mm. • manuals and advisories. • a promo code for your next blade purchase. price-. this trimmer is priced at rs 2199 which is reasonable for this multi use premium quality trimmer. always check for offers on amazon to get the best deal. i wanted a good shaver for a long time that can give me fast and smooth shave without me going through the hassle of foam and razor as my beard grows fast and requires shaving in an interval of 2-3 days.. i was initially skeptical about buying phillips oneblade as i was not sure of the value but believe me this is the real deal breaker when it comes to budget shavers. i have used it a couple of times and i\\'m completely satisfied with the its job. it really lives up to its tagline - style, shave and trim. thank you, philips, for such an amazing product that provides great value. this trimmer plus shaver is easily one of the two-in-one kind of products available. as mentioned it does the work of both the shaving and trimming which is just amazing. thought it has 3 different levels of trimmer beard, which are just sufficient for my beard. the charging speed is fast comparing to others trimmer in the same segment and the battery lasts for longer than i thought. really an another great product by philips. 1 month use :. u can get shave as a barber without using foam , or anything. it will shave like a pro without hurting you.. smooth gliding.. hard hair are easy to cut.. cons :. doesn\\'t have a small brush to clean as philips provide in others.. charging indicator doesn\\'t show full charge status. product came same as per picture . it\\'s too early to post the review still will try to highlight whatever max possible.. efficient cutting , cleans totally on body parts. and very neat on shave . good grip . battery looks doable . ergonomic. color is good . you get a 50% disc voucher on next blade purchase.. but. neck connection is too delicate if used vigorously can break , handle with care while cleaning . the blade to change i can\\'t say bcz it\\'s only 2 weeks to buy . pls note it\\'s good while using ....only delicate when you separate parts for cleaning . expensive. the blade is very delicate and will require to be replaced often. the concept is closer to a cartridge type razor, very different from the rugged electric shavers so far being sold by phillips at a much lower cost.. shave is smooth and no complaints about the battery. it’s super expensive for its use and takes ages to charge and it’s blades are very expensive so just skip it phillips has cracked a master piece with a mix of trimmer and razor. the one blade not only trims the beard but also gives a clean shave. the blade is very smooth on skin and doesn\\'t hurt at all. it is ipx7 which makes it easy to use even during shower. it is a perfect compact tool which can be used during travel for grooming your beard. the battery life is prettt decent as well. the product is value for money. this new range of trimmers from phillips are the worst. i have tried both one blade and the body groomer. they both are useless. do not clean the area after multiple attempts. this one even hurts a little. the previous ones i have had were also from phillips but atleast they were a little more useful than these new ones. they at least worked for some time. i am extremely dissatisfied with the quality of these. i bought before 1.5 months back. blade is not working now. no respond from the service centre. warranty not for blame even for 1.5 month old. i rarely used it. very unfortunate blade cost around 900. product cost 1999/-. pathetic.... product is very good. but the maintenance cost is very high. that is the cost of replacement of blade. earlier philips product does not require such high replacement cost of blade. 3 times replacement cost of blade is equale to the cost of acquisition of the product. the material between the machine and the blade is of extremely fragile material. it broke off on my 5th use. i have used other trimmers from philips which have lasted me for years so didn’t expect such low quality from philips product. the blade is also quite expensive being half the price of the trimmer. i would advise buying another trimmer/shaver. i he raised several complain n my brother whom i have gifted too raised many complain but till date nothing has happened. he has send many complaints through his twitter account lovemenot143 but result is zero. product is laying unused. if you cannot do anything than tell me once. but i m really very disappointed with the attitude of your customer service.if you return this money than do it or please replace it. if you wanted to talk than do call 9903801938 not easy to use, clean shave require too many attempts to ensure no hair is left out, you really have to learn effective way of shaving, like in my case i\\'ve to move it down to up and too many time resulting in slight skin burn when washing or applying after shave. product is not offering the goods as per mentioned as they say \"free blade available\". the point is that there is always a free blade with the product however, the sellers quote was free blade that means that there shouk have been 2 free blades. the worst part is that you can\\'t cancel the order and you have to live with that. finally a new version of a shaver.. as it is so different it is a little difficult to get used to when you have been using a traditional. hand razor for so long. after a few days the results are really good. easy to use and clean.. recommended! it is not good for saving..... during the use it is hurting and saving speed is very slow. i was never expecting such poor performer from philips. still m using phillips trimmer only which is working 10 time better than this saver. it\\'s waste of money... will not recomend anyone. ready to saleout my unit at 50% discount (only 4 minutes used) like=easy to use. dislike= 1. wastage of money. i bought in 2200 rupees. not worthy. 2. battery takes 8 hrs to charge. waste of electricity.. 3 blade quality is poor. conclusion= dont waste your money. i had never bought trimmer. it was my first time. phillips is a trusted brand. and this product is a useless. please guys dont waste your money. the product does not seems to specify all the specifications clearly, as i replaced the product but then also donot see the charging light in different colors, as claimed by the company. either the complete lot with the supplier is having the same issue or the company itself is not providing it from the manufacturing unit itself. either somebody should clarify if i need to go for another replacement or somebody can deliver a new checked quality product and get my current product replaced or else confirm me that there are no charging lights, which appear in the product while charging. first time i bought philips product and its disappoint me. and i lost 1698rupees. for a useless product and brand. i will not recommend any product of this brand.. and i can\\'t return this product only replacement option is there.. so guys please avoid this product. i liked the product philips qp2525/10 oneblade hybrid trimmer because it is very easy and convenient to use. also, it is really very comfortable when using the trimmer. also, the trimmer can be used to clean the body hair. i used it to clean my armpits and legs hair and it was really very soothing experience.. one thing i didn\\'t like about the product is the charging indicator. i was not able to understand the battery backup of the product. also, there was no manual which would help me to understand the current charge status of my battery. secondly, it\\'s not easy to clean the blades after the usage because a lot of hair gets stuck in the tip of the trimmer. trimming/shaving speed is slow as compared to trimmer.. i had a philips trimmer only... it was so smooth that from the beard area i use it once it gives perfect trimming. but this oneblade trimming speed is very slow. it takes a lot of time in trimming eiter you have to go really slow or trim 2-3 times in same area to get proper trimming look otherwise uneven hairs can be noticed. i don\\'t suggest it. you might be tempted by the price of this trimmer. but the whole business of this trimmer is the blades. you\\'ll need to replace them every 2-3 months and a set of 2 blades costs ~ rs.1400/-.. it\\'s cheaper to get a regularly good shave at a barber shop than purchasing this trimmer. this is the best trimmer/shaver i have used so far. it\\'s design is very ergonomic and the blade is so thin and fast that the shaving feels as if it\\'s done using razor. battery life is around 40-45 minutes. i can shave for 5-6 times on single charge. for styling purpose there are 3 different combs available. overall its worth buying. i have heard some great reviews about the philip\\'s one blade trimmer. have been wanting to keep a beard but the grooming and styling often feels like a pain. with my all new and versatile philip\\'s trimmer hopefully beard styling will become easy and cool with this. its a big thing to say but i\\'d give it 6 stars if i could.. when i talk about the battery life, i\\'ve used it more than \"5 times\" since purchase for not less than 15 minutes each time without charging even for once.. easy to handle and its water resistance makes it easier to clean too.. the life-span of a blade is one thing that i\\'m not sure about yet.. apparently its quite fragile, so keep it out of reach of children to avoid physical damage and use it gently with sophistication.. packaging was perfectly fine too with not a single part missing. i don\\'t know about the quality because i didn\\'t use it. the package i received was broken. but it is nicely stickered with the torn plastic. when i opened the package i saw beards inside the blades and the packet. just imagine if some hiv patient used it before. carelessness!! the product is quite good in its functioning. as a dry shaver, it takes a little longer than a wet one. but that\\'s great coz then you can shave almost anyhwhere without worrying.. the issue i have had with it is that the blades break very easily and are really expensive to replace. the joints on the blade that connect the body to the blade are flimsy. the original one broke in 3 days. the next one broke in 7. and once it breaks, there is nothing you can do. so i have now put it to the side and gone back to my old way of shaving. don\\'t want to spend 600 every week on a weak replaceable part. the blades are very fragile and easily break. the plastic is flimsy and only after 2 3 uses it just breaks from the joints. i purchased another set of blades within one month of use and again the same thing happened.. avoid buying this product, because although the quality of shave is good the blades keep breaking frequently and replacing them is a costly affair as each blade costs around 800rs. another awasome quality product by philips.. smooth trimming. no irretation on skin.. thanks to dual side blade which is very effective. and blade has a protective plate on top of the cutter, preventing the blade from touching skin.. bettery backup is more than expected or written on the product description. i have been using philips trimmers from a long time. and i must say this one is best among all. the main three reasons to buy this trimmer are:. 1. amazing battery life of 40min. you van use it for weeks in just one charge. 2. easy to handle design. its very compact to carry anywhere.. 3. one blade is fabulous for trimming and shaving. no need to change any blades.. my trust for philips trimmer has increased and amazon delivered it right before time i ordered philips qp2525/10 one blade hybrid trimer. its a great product very very easy to use i have ever used any trimer. this is best trimer. its battery life is too good. and aslo washable and easy to style the bread and also used for clean savings. its really awasome product i am totally satisfied with it i recommended for purchasing this product. thank you fully satisfied with the product quality. it has three trimming comb 1mm, 3mm and 5mm and has dual side blade. other features like precision, quality, durability, cleaning parts etc. are not to be worried from a brand like phillips.the build quality is good. it doesn\\'t feel cheap when you hold the trimmer. the comb attachment is also convenient. i had no idea philips can produce such dubious product.. the blade needs to be replaced and the cost o it is similar to the product itself.. electric shaver never need blade replacements, atleast till now, but this needs replacement!!!. dont waste your money on this product. very less durability. the blade is useful only for 3 to 4 months. blade cost is half of trimmer price. so, not advisable to buy as blade needs to be changed for every 4 months. writing review after using for 5 months... hello, out there !. overall in short, it is worth buying at this price around ₹1700/-. i have bought the product and used it twice without doing charging once i have set my beard and second time i have done clean shave which is 100% of bettry usage. the gadget is very easy to use and clean and the main usp is you dont need to worry about cutting it will not harm the skin doesnt matter either you go upward or downward, the two side blades are too smooth, just one limitation is we can use it for setting the beard or clean shave it will do it really well but doing cut on edges is bit less sharp. one blade is like best trimmer and shaving appliance in budget. it provides a premium feel on face. there will be no cuts. it shaves sensitive area so well that a normal razor is unable to do without a cut. one must add this to travel pouch as it is best grooming companion and saves my money from going to salon for shaping the beard. one can put it on charge while sleeping at night and in morning the appliance is ready to use and give you a fresh look. one can try different lengths of trimmer accordingly. it is my first and best grooming appliance. there is a problem with charger or the trimmer. philips manual clearly states that there is a green indicator on the charger but its not working. i even logged a complaint with philips customer care, but no solution has been provided yet the cleaning capacity of the trimmer provided to me is not as sufficient as shown in videos.i doubt the trimmer provided to me had the used blade attached to it because the life of the blade is atleast 3-4 months shown and in 4-5th clean shave only it is not able to function properly.due to travelling in this lockdown was not able to return the product and really not satisfied with the product provided to me. this is the second time i am buying a philips trimmer i would say it\\'s really good i previously use a trimmer philips after using for 2 years in died away.this famous really good you can really designer shape your beard or moustache whatever you like. overall a great product from philips with great price. very poor quality. one of my combs (comb size- 5) keeps slipping out while shaving. i reported it to philips via facebook messenger but got no help. also, the combs aren’t available for purchase anywhere. there’s also no provision to avail the 50% off on the first replacement blade coupon which comes with every one blade. it’s a total scam!! don’t go for this product. the first time i am using a battery powered trimmer for shaving. i used always the conventional method.. good part:. 1. love the color and shape. perfectly fits into my hand.. 2. easy to use and does not need much effort.. 3. i found it more smooth and safe to use; did not get any cuts using the same.. 4. good for trimming thick beards.. 5. good to style the beard to shape.. as i travel a lot, will come handy and fit well in my kit.. cons:. 1. does not give a clean shave at the first stroke. have to run it 2-3 times to give smooth and clean shave. so bit time consuming.. 2. small strands of hair go in, so bit tough to clean.. 3. the plastic head with blade seems to be bit fragile.. overall a good product. hope this review is helpful.. will give more updates soon. this update is after continuous use of this product for few days now. this lovely looking slim one blade is magic. think so this is first of it\\'s kind to give such a clean shave as well. this being the trusted brand since my childhood comes out with new innovation and this is one of them.. got this as gift to friend who can now trim his beard with three diff sizes combs available in it or just can do a clean shave both wet and dry.. handling this is easy and perfect economical shape with rubberised grip gives satisfaction while shaving. no. worries of cutting and skin damage henceforth. nice product from this brand.. cons- not much but one is that the shaver is bit delicate and costly bit it cant be the deal breaker amazing product for a nice trim or shave. has a blade closure attachment to keep the blades closed while not in use. the trimmers are also quite effective. overall a good product for upkeep of the beard. only con is the recharge time. one of the few products which function as described. the design is absolutely brilliant. it helps you to style , trim and shave as per your need in an easiest way. you can style yourself in just few minutes. battery life is good. skin friendly as well. overall the best trimmer so far this can literally do anything you need. and the design is flawless and it\\'s super easy to use. mad improvement in shaving technology. only wish they upgraded the battery as it still takes follows basic industry standards when there are few companies coming up with trimmers that have great recharge times.. but you can\\'t get everything i guess philips replaces philips only -- gr8 shift from earlier product that i used - acquatouch.. i was hesitant to move from acquatouch as i am habbitual to it.... but this one is not just replacement but a notch up in shaving ..... please don\\'t buy this product, you will waste your money.. a peoduct is good when you are able to use it, the product cleans the shave cleanly but it takes too much time and repeatitions.. when you are standing in front of mirror, oh the battery is not charged again wait for charging. no charging indicator and many more.. not a worth product, need many improvement. very unhappy with this product. review dekhke acha lag rha tha bt it was not. not easy to use, when remove the comb whole blade part was remove with this comb at same time, bar bar blade clean krna padta hai nhi to balde thik se kam nhi krta hai for this issue halka save krne m time bahut lag jata hai, good thing is that battery acha hai, clean save sahi se hota hai, bad thing is written up. not recommend to anyone bt recommend for those jisko clean save e chaiye.. one more bad thing is balde price is too high 2piece blade cost m 1piece trimmer aajayega.. overall very bad experience.. i would have loved to give it a 5 stars for the quality of the product. but it does not give you a close shave as shared in adverts. the blade isn\\'t very sharp and hence the problem. i would have expected a better shave going by the price of this. i have been using this product since last 4 months. i use it once or twice a week, with a 5 mins run each. never had issues with the battery, i charge it just once a month. i was happy with the overall experience using this trimmer until the blade body broke. the plastic on the blade body is very fragile. i was browsing to buy a replacement blade, and was shocked to see the price of the replacement blade. it costs rs 850, which is almost half of the price of the trimmer! really? how can a company like philips not see this as a problem? i would have been happy if the maintance cost of this trimmer was easy on pocket. i purchased this product in the lockdown itself for trimming and making my beard look good. it\\'s easy to use, to clean and good enough battery life. i really like the concept of oneblade, it\\'s quite different and helpful from others.. one thing i have an issue about it the comb size, they should really provide some more variety in comb size\\'s. the size\\'s available are 5mm, 3mm and 1mm.. one more thing that i\\'m upset about it that they mentioned a new blade with the product but didn\\'t delivered it. now, i have to buy a new one by myself whenever needed. this product is hyped unnecessarily, though its okay to be used as a trimmer. however, this is not good as a shaver. it works really slow.. it quite ergonomic and easy to handle. however, i do mark down when it comes to performance. would cost you almost the same as a good quality traditional blade without any skin irritation, redness, rashes and cuts. long-lasting 45min battery backup on a single charge, which would easily last 15 to 20 days. i am really happy with this buy. and it is highly recommended. absolutely wonderful product. i can\\'t find a fault even after looking for it. the cuts are very clean and easy. trims very well and evenly. the attachments are sufficient. battery just keeps on going (it\\'s two months now since first charge and it is still going despite twice a week moderate use). very fast and fine cutter. good ergonomic hold and looks stylish. very easy to clean. the battery life of this trimmer is extremely long and amazing. the style and the grip is very attractive. it’s very easy to handle and easy to use. since it’s waterproof, it’s easy to use even in a shower while having a bath. the trimmer shaves the skin till the very last mm. it’s amazing. it is very slim. easy to handle and it has long battery life. its not a shaver but it gives very close trims. you can give the lining to your beard and moustache. no need to use pencil knife after trimming. any style you want. i am using it for last four months and i am fully satisfied. amazing trimmer, trims all the hair and without putting any marks on the face.. works like a blade only for shave, and battery life of the trimmer is very good. being my 2nd trimmer of philips, very happy from the product. i purchased the onebladw last month and also purchased two additional blades for rs. 850.00. i have used it just once and came to vietnam. today when i switched on the devise, it is not working and dead. i recharged the same for a long time but of no use.. what is the quality of product which did not work even for a month. donot know what to do. philips turned out to be worse than a 500 bucks product which you buy from a local market. the blade broke and they are not willing to replace it. 50 tweets and nothing. please do not buy this cheap product .. its not worth it .. waste of your money if you are looking for head hair trim.. safety - no its safety cover doesn’t provide proper closure. battery- not powerful enough for head hair trim. only useful for facial hair trim useless for head hairs. waste of money. very nice, it\\'s excellent product. i gifted it to my hubby and same day i received it he used this and the result was mind blowing it shaved as clean as razor. but quite expensive. i was looking for something to replace my old philips series 7000 trimmer and this is what i chose after a lot of research. the entire package looks beautiful, it’s easy to hold and glides against my face like butter on a hot cast iron skillet. personally, i’m using it to get that quick and clean last minute shave before a meeting or a date and it has not disappointed yet. it is an excellent tool. no nicks and i don\\'t have a thick beard, it works just fine giving me a clean shave. i have used it for 2 weeks only, so cannot give an idea about its durability. one possible problem could be toughening off the beard and dryness of the cheeks. however, not a big drawback. it\\'s been a month now and it\\'s an amazing product from philips ,one of a kind when it comes to trimmers and shavers.the only thing which needs improvement is that battery charging time must be less( it\\'s 8hrs now without any indication ) given the fact that many contemporary trimmers have a charging time of around 1 hr.. using it is way easy just like other trimmers however cleaning remains an issue as it doesn\\'t come with any brush so small hairs do remain stuck in the blade area,is a tedious job to get them out.. despite these issues, i would still recommend it to all those looking for a smoooth trimming and shaving experience . this little machine is from the future.i have a full beard with defined lines and oneblade has worked wonders in terms of its performance, it styled my beard and defined the lines really well and when it comes to shaving it actually shaves really close almost as close as a safety razor, keeping the skin soft and with less irritation even while dry shaving.. it’s quite comfortable while shaving with or against the grain and also very easy to use at tricky places of your face as blades on both sides allows you flexibility to use it in any direction.. for me, all my beard styling problems got solved with philips oneblade. please don\\'t fall for it.. damaged on the first use itself. the blade is extremely delicate and breaks off easily. the catch is, the replacement blade is kept costly for the same reason to generate profit. please avoid buying. if you are a bald, go for it. i am a bald and it\\'s the best trimmer i have used. i was tired of using straight blade and cuts and blood, but now i got the right product for my problem. no other trimmer would be that good for a bald man i believe. it\\'s best for bald head and shaving beard and forearms and any other part ;) product is really amazing. its very easy to use. it\\'s not suitable for zero size shaving. but the results are so good that little size hair are not visible to others. you can just feel these hair by touching. i think you should definitely choose this product. it\\'s best at this price. it is giving 2 years warranty also. overall best product in best price. this is a very capable product, i don\\'t even required to use shaving cream/foam to clean my beard, very effective and efficient.. but, where it lacks is a packaging defect, it is very hard to use a first as the instructions as not clear.. also it is difficult to clean and cannot be cleaned unless the blade is removed, and the battery life is questionable.. other than that, if you use it for 3-4 times it is a very good product, i would recommend it to all of you guys. single solution for all your trimming and shaving needs. very easy to use..can be used as a wet as well as dry shaver. gives a very clean shave with no irritation. very ergonomic, efficient & multi purpose. definitely worth the buy. about product:. - classic product from phillips.. - the perfect two-in-one product for shaving and trimming the beard. the trendy looks along with lightweight and sleek design will add more value to the trimmer.. performance:. - the phillips one blade is perfect for regular beard trimming as well as for shaving on a regular basis.. - i used for both trimming & shaving, i must tell you, the performance is amazing. also combs given with the kit fits perfectly to have a stylish beard.. - it is very less noisy as compared to regular trimmers. - battery life is excellent. approx 35 - 45 mins usage after 8 hours charging. - no irritation on skin. - very easy to clean after the usage. - value for money. to sum up, i should say that, this is must have trimmer for men. go for it. totally recommended. too delicate to use. blade got broken with in 10days. i have a very thin beard and takes lot of time to use. better to go with 3-blader eventhough little costlier not worth the price. pros:. 1. easy to use. 2. easy to clean. 3. sharp edge can help to adjust the style. cons. 1. battery life: you need to charge it fir 8 hours to use 45 minutes. no battery indicators. 2. doesn\\'t cut the facual hairs of same length. once you move on a same part again, you get the uneven length. even a basic streamer is better to level the facial hairs. 3. blade adjustment is delicate. it\\'s cheap plastic which can\\'t sustain even a little pressure blade becomes useless after 1 or 2 months, battery backup is pathetic, replacement blade single unit costs 800/- approx. new technology designed for men who wear facial styles and grow beards. dual-sided blade for easy styling and precise edges. it stays comfortable even in sensitive areas, so it\\'s fast and easy to get your style in seconds. the dual protection system keeps your skin protected, no matter trim or shave. i have been using phillips trimmer since long time. tried this new product and trust me it is simply amazing. it is easy to hold and easy to trim beard. its sharp edges helps to give good shape to your beard which is all wanted by men.. it is a must purchase for all men. a real breakthrough i presume. it works as described. tried a wet shave a dry. works equally good. a very clean shave on a week stub... i did not have to scrub a lor. while the product build is great , long handles give u a good grip and stability while moving around ur face . the attachment is of use but could have been of better quality, the blade cover could have been more friendly need to be a bit gentle else i would end up yankjng the blade off the handle . overall good product for beginners who are attempting sporting a beard trust me the trimmer is awesome. only downside of it is the cost of new blade. the blade part is very fragile. if trimmer accidentally fall then the blade will definitely broke and you have to purchase new blade which is around 800₹. in this price point you can buy a new trimmer in the market. the blade cost should not more than 250. best for beard trimming.. very good for shaving. not 100% fine, but inching for sensitive screen.. good for hair triming, but you need proper judgement how much triming required using 3 adjusters.. cons - no battery full charging indication. i have returned once for same reason. then gone through one of review for same. battery life is extraordinary. the trimmer is really good, i feel it most comfortable in using it because of its unique design. using without any comb number is most suitable for my beard and i struggle a bit when i have to use the guard combs to get a good look. otherwise, for zero number trimming its best. battery life is good, charge time is sufficient and easy to clean. i choose this over mi expecting the quality and performance of this product to be far better than mi.. honestly, maybe it\\'s better but not far more better if compare to price.. pros - size small.. blade small.. cuts evenly.. cons - takes too much time to charge... doesn\\'t have many length settings. washing is hard. and hair gets stuck in blade. finally - if you don\\'t trim beard that much.. then go for this . and yes. if you 8 hours of time to charge it.. first impressive look and quality of philips.. blade giving best performance to shave and trimming, 3 types of adjustment to give different shaving look.. oneblade working near about 35-45minutes on battery backup and it\\'s a advantage of philips products.. overall thin build construction of trimmer is very good smarty and attractive. i bought it mainly for shaving. happy so far. the head is too small compared to electric rotary shavers like aquatouch so takes more time to shave the whole face. however its better in cleaning tricky areas like under neck or moustache due to the same reason. it surprisingly cuts with very less irritation compared to other electric shavers. finally i see a shaver which does not need to change the blade when i need a different kind of shave. keep clean shave, keep a full grown beard or a french beard, this one blade can do it all.. such a great convenience. thankyou philips for making this easier. i was looking for replacement of my old trimmer, philips 3000 series, which is more than 3 years old. suddenly i came across this product (oneblade) and i ordered it without giving it a second thought. i tried my hand on and the trimmer really does the job in a smooth way. it is possible to make sharp cuts without difficulty. worth every penny. i have been using oneblade from like 3 months and as compared to other trimmers and shavers i must say its quite efficient.. its slim design is a ++. and as compared to others its battery backup is quite good. and it even works when ur beard is wet.. value for money and a product that u must go for :) can style, trim and shave precisely. good to style facial hair as it doesn’t shave too closely like a traditional blade. since my husband has just started using it, we cannot comment on the battery life. product is extremely good for using it for shave or trim...even on the groin area too .my opinion is..don\\'t waste your time by looking for trimmer...go for this shaver..it shaves very well without cutting skin....and it has comb too..so that you can trim also...and another thing is that..that there\\'s runtime written over there about 45 mins...but it runs more than 45 seconds...which i experienced that...very skin friendly also..nice product... first i got open package and few part were missing (blade & comb). i requested replacement and amazon did it within 24 hr. it happened first time that opened box delivered and parts were missing. but the way amazon responded, was really lightning fast.. now as for as product is concern, it looks and feels like comfortable easy to use and effective. battery life durability can be realized only after use of few months. overall good product. premium quality product,feels like shave experience, battery backup is also good ,you can 2-3 times with single charge, blade is very delicate and costly,got 50% discount card on next replacement blade but not getting after registering product many times on philips website and price of one blade is 850 rupee which is very high... it\\'s effortless, styles trims & shaves like a charm & looks super cool while doing it !. love the fact that i didn\\'t have to worry about any scratches / itchiness compared to both trimmers & shavers post a grooming session!. completely safe as it never touches the skin! awesome that it also has wet and dry capabilities!. it feels super premium to hold ! the perfect grooming tool that has ever existed till date!. \"one blade to rule them all \" i bought this and it has instantly replaced my razor and my trimmer.. beard styling has become to easy for me.. this also gives me a clean shave when required.. the battery just goes on and on. its been over 5-6 months and i had to charge the battery only once after it was charged fully before the first use.. it was a brilliant buy. hi team, i didn\\'t receive charger with the product. had not opened the box until recently and was aghast to find that their wasn\\'t any charger with the product. kindly look into thr same and oblige !!. even if you could provide me a new one with acceptable cost, i would be grateful as my whole investment\\'s gone for a toss without it otherwise. one of the best trimmer from philips i tried many but nothing would match the easy, comfort of this one i would definitely 200% recommend it to people who used blade and other trimmers and who are allergy to shaving. one of the best thing i noted is that its comfort, after shaving i just don\\'t feel any iching or pain try it you will definitely notice it at first use superb! and i have recommended it to my friend they also was surprised to know the difference... i love this product. bought this as a gift for my husband. it is really easy to use without any hassle. battery lasts really long that means it has an amazing battery life and i found it completely value for money worth buying and recommending it. have also bought extra pair of blades along . it\\'s a hybrid of the shaving and trimming. excellent for the beard style, but also a good choice for the clean shave. also the precisely works while trimming. so overall its a best solution from philips for who requires the both, shave and trim. absolutely satisfied with this product. it\\'s so easy to use. and it really gives a close shave, i would say it achieves 90% of what a gillette fusion achieves. and that too quickly. that\\'s good enough for me.. battery life is decent. i had charged it overnight at the beginning of the month and the battery is still working even after a month. quite reasonable.. very easy to use and easy to clean. and most importantly, no chances of cuts. kudos philips!! it’s delicate , not capable of delivering a clean shave especially for a hard stubble , can’t handle constant shaving hence stops abruptly ,no indication of battery at low, difficult to shave under the chin areas. knowing philips hopefully they will change the flaws , can’t be relied upon and back up regular shaving razor blade is a must making it undependable its not a shaver, but a trimmer. but a good one which trims hair or rather shaves very near to the skin without any pulls or cuts. a good and a handy trimmer. hope the blade replacement will be available in future. my beared is little harder due to regular shave , but phillips one blade works smooth and fine on my hard beared too. i tried both dry shaving and wet shaving , in both cases i got excellent results.. pros. > smooth shave. > safe to use(no cut marks even on hard beared). >easy to use. > water proof. cons. >long charging time - 8 hours. i liked the ease of using, fits into my palm very conveniently, battery charge comes for several shaves. i am not very comfortable with cleaning, but it is ok. i will continue with it for a long time. very happy.... very easy to handle .there is no problem with blade to skin. smooth shave without irritation. philips has done great work in terms of asthetics. battery life is awesome . really its worth price. more trimming setting has been given. powerful and sturdy. trimming power of blades is superb just got this trimmer and shaver, it looks good and my first use was quite impressive. and have just used it 4-5 times. over all the product is performing well. the down side to it is, the chargi g time of 8hours is a bit longer and and major factor is replacement of the blades every few months as per claimed by the company. great product, used this electric razor for the first time. it is better than ordinary trimmers in the market as it gives ability to trim as per style and as well as do clean shave like a normal razor. battery is also long lasting. highly recommended if you are using traditional razors. it saves so much of time. new blade costs 849 rs that is half the cost of trimmer itself. blade life only 4 months. cash machine for philips. think before you purchase. no extra advantage from blade yet wears out in 4 months with 2 full trim usage per week. think before you buy. i recommend philips 3221/15 which has no blade replacement needs. cash machine for philips. don\\'t buy unless u want to replace it every 4 months costing 849 rs without any added advantage. as expected from phillips. i am using phillips trimmers from the begining and they had never let me down. it has 2 attachments which will satisfy the thickness requirement in your mustache or beared. am using philips products since many years. i purchased this product also without any doubt, as usual. it\\'s compact and easy to use. no tangles, smooth and flexi shaving, easy to clean and easy to handle, easy styling, good battery backup. the negatives are, that\\'s the cost of blade, which is expensive and it would be good if a case or pouch had given for everyday use after unboxing. battery life is long lasting. can work for 2 to 3 days without charging. the product is very easy to use. very safe for skin as there is not a single cut. can be used for wet and dry skin. the grip is very good. product is of good quality and a useful accessory for travelling. it is very useful product.. 1) good battery life. 2) attachments are of three different sizes i.e 1mm, 3mm & 5mm. 3) works smoothly on your skin. 4) doesn\\'t cause any redness/rashes. 5) you can use it any direction you want.. upside/down or horizontal/vertical. it works absolutely fine. 6) easy to clean. 7) comes with a plastic cover which helps in keeping the blade sustainable for a longer period best trimmer i have ever used. far far better than philips\\' last trimmer qt4011/15 if you want nearly a close shave.. even it is far better than so many razors. it gives you like a clean shave if you use it without combs.. only con is it\\'s charging time which is 8 hrs(for qt4011/15, it is 1 hr) but i think it is not a big problem. philips one blade hybrid trimmer and shaver is a perfect for trimming my beard in early morning rush hours. it gives me perfect finish.. its a must have for all the beard owners i feel.. the product is handy and its sub zero feature actually works good.. you can expect it to give you a clean shave look dor sure.. i expect blade life to be less as it already started showing the marking to expire soon, and its just around 5 triming/shaving experience i had in 2 months.. overall good product! if you are expecting a clean shave from this product than this is not a product for you.. the trimmer is easy to clean after use as its waterproof and you can just rinse it under running water. but switching between different lengths is not very seamless as other philips productxls the product is extremely handy and effective. i used it for shaping my beard and also trimming it. it was extremely easy to do it myself and the results were remarkable too. i am really happy with my purchase. watching this product fir long for its durability, once found this product worth use from users tried to buy but due to covid couldn\\'t visit any store, got it here for a reasonable price, thanks i would recommend not buying this. 1) the hair gets stuck to the blade.. 2) the blade gets dull within a month and half.. 3) the trimmer works very terribly and leaves half the long hairs intact.. 4) there are other shavers and trimmers that can keep the hair in and you can use it anywhere.. 5) for me it’s been 2 months and the shaver is not even able to cut my beard after going through the area 3 times in every direction. it will not give a clean shave specially if used without a shaving cream/foam. one has to press the blade hard against his cheek to get a ok quality shave will definetly make the skin rough after regular usage. current 4 months life of the blade claimed by the manufacturer is a misscommunication as this would happen only if a person shaves twice a week. its a uni body plastic design, easy to use ,battery life is good .. a unique blade design shave clean.. real traditional razor killer.. you can even use it under shower.. 3 sets of standard stencil recived for beard designing.. slightly heavier then other trimmer. good but not very innovative product difficult to use , earlier trimmers was easier this one gives lot of cuts as well the plastic pin connecting blade is broken either in transit or on first use . reported to philips whose technician said he would require authorisation to replace or i have to pay over one thousand for blade .i am waiting for response. yes its innovative if you can do close shaving as you can do with blades ( say 95 to 98% close), yes its multi-purpose, only concern is the price for blade replacements which is exorbitant to some extent un-acceptable..else i would have given 5 good quality and useful for both trimming the beard and for clean shaving. but the material is very delicate and to be handled softly while changing the blades or washing this item looking of the product price battery life is poor.finishing is very good but 100 percentage clean shave is impossible. cost is too much.charging lead is not available in the market excellent product gives a salon like trimming and shaving results. charge indicator would have really helped. nevertheless worth having this is our armary upgraded from philips aquatouch. much sleeker and handy than aquatouch with the same wet and dry capabilities. one blade for all needs makes it easy to maintain this product is good and does its job well. although it takes bit longer if you want a clean shave. but yes if you are not in a mood for foam and all, you can just glide this.. for those who are used to shaving with a razor like gillette mach3 fusion, ont expect that quality from this one. it a trimmer blade and not a razor easy to use and gives a clean look. the design of the product gives you a perfect grip and easy to move around your face. battery life is satisfactory. could have added a battery level indicator as a feature. the combs are also good. could have included a travel pouch for storage . overall a very good product. this trimmer has the ability to chop hairs on both the sides unlike the other regular trimmer\\'s, making the trimming session smooth & really easy & effortless.. this comes with a solid gripper making the trimmer movement easy... any body looking to find the sweet spot with the facial look\\'s concerned i would highly recommend you buy it... don\\'t wait.. just buy.. charge it overnight for a clean shave. i think this is a very good shaver cum trimmer ... but we have to be very careful about the head and the blade as it is very brittle . a fall and it was gone... therefore i dont recommend this at all. seems to be useless device . repenting that i bought it.. can’t understand what’s the purpose of this device over older trimmer.. can’t shave in place of shaver- can’t trim well. a good trimmer for people who prefer to keep stubble style beard and also used to groom beard upto medium length.. you can also use it if you want clean shave without water and shaving cream as it gives smooth clean shave look.. but strictly not for people who keep long beard bcoz it comes with only 3 combs out of which max length you get is 5mm. everything is fine about this trimmer except that its blade is very very fragile. mine got broken with just a very little blow. so i ordered a compatible blade but that\\'s too pricy. the product feels good when it\\'s initial use. but the silent motto behind this product is it\\'s blade, customers should have pay a huge amount to purchase it\\'s blades even it doesn\\'t lasts not too much for a daily shave. it is very costly unless they reduce the cost of blade upto 50-60%. does the job well. trims as well as any trimmer i\\'ve used before. shaves very well, not as close as a conventional blade, but you wouldn\\'t be able to tell the difference on sight. very handy and easy to travel with. it\\'s not a shaver atall... daily shaver won\\'t be getting anything special from one blade.. it is even not 1 percent of traditional razors... totally disappointed....really false claims made by phillips about its shaving experience... amazing innovation by phillips. serves the purpose well. you can shave without worrying about the sharp blades. blades are changeable and it holds enough charge for 3-4 shaves. as far as trimming is concerned there should have been more attachments. betty life - unsatisfied, just 45 min run timr with 8 hrs charging time. worst to talk about this. not ok. easy to use - size of blade is too short which is difficult to shave and trim,. shaving- the blade work in micro fine compare to others but razor is all time perfect to shave, philips should more improve this product in shaving. 1. does not give clean and smooth shave.. 2. takes too long to charge. 3. charge lasts for only 45 minutes.. 4. no indicator light on the handle to indicate charge status-major handicap.. 5. the cost of replacement blade is exorbitant.. 6. worst experience is no return possible!! it should be easy to return and get refund or buy a better product with the money saved by getting refund for this useless item. it’s a great product for those who don’t want to use razors & also need trimmed beard. regular trimmers are a pain to use. but this one is comfortable & also lets for greater options.. but, you really need to use it very carefully. as you can see from pic the joint/link b/w removable head & actual blade is very very thin, its like that to keep it very very flexible and to make to move according to the shape of face and give a clean shave , but this gentle joint is not durable and breaks after 20/30 use.... thought it is bad design, when i saw blade only cost is 800 , looks like a money making idea. best of all trimmers till now i used in my life excellent product from philips. one blade is 3 in 1 blade with which can you trim, shape and shave. i thought this to be a shaver and bought it. you could use it to give yourself some really nice shaves and trim. batterybackup is really really nyc. so,this product is amazing if you want a clean shave you need to do it dry shave and that will much better.. in all it’s a good product i really like philips, they really made good products. this one blade trimmer is also unique idea of doing trimming & clean shave from one device. blade is really good, i did complete shave, and trust me this piece is totally awesome. the blade is so smooth..... can be used as trimmer & not shaver for hard beard, not suitable for shaving at all. reverse stroke for getting a clean shave is not at all comfortable & hardens the skin.... excellent one bleade philips innovation is great and easy to use.very nice product. very easy to use and the product looks very good, give very secure clean shave look super cool. and best shave fast and fantastica product long lasting battery life awesome product didn’t expect this to be such good. doesn’t give complete clean shave as razor does, but that is not expected from this aswell. it is very smooth, earlier had a product similar to this where hair used to get stucked and pulled, but this glides like anything and does its work as said.. overall a very nice product just charging time is a bit more but that should be fine. this is absolutely a garbage product. philips tried to package it with a superior look but efficiency sucks. it takes time to trim the hair. have to make lot of efforts for close trimming. i have used philips other trimmers which was easy to use for close trimming. i recommend it for trimmer users who r using trimmers for long time and use that perfectly. not for new user. handle with carefully otherwise u will face cut on you. very useful product to shave in home. specially in this pandemic situation. its super easy to use and the one blade feature gives freedom to shave trim and style any way, in any direction that i want. the battery life is good. looking forward to many such men grooming products. received the shaver today. happy with the performance. i got close shave . very low noice as well. only negitive point is it does not have ac - dc option.overall good result. thanks philips and amazon for wonderfull product. superb , extra ordinary, best among all other trimmers in this price segment. easy to use its smooth, can easily be cleaned or even can be washed with water. only one problem is that , its charging is very slow , it takes 8 hours to charge , and must have light notification for charging. the product delivered on time i really appreciate that.. the trimmer was well packed as i expected.. i used many brands trimmer but phillips is the best trimmer amongs them, in terms of battery, looks wise, quality and material of trimmer is good, it is easy and safe to use. i recommend this trimmer to everyone they must use it ones. i have been using the original blade (which i got with the pack)now for over an year but didn\\'t feel the need to change the blade yet.. its working fine, battery life is good.. i usually use it weekly or once in 10days to clean body hairs n nothing else. the product is good for cleaning the short beard or trimming the hair but it not work well with long beard as the trimmer collect hair in the teeth and some time if u put pressure then the balde come out. this is a great product. so,easy to use and gives a very clean shave. the blades are also very powerful and has a long life. its been 4 months and it is still effective. product is good.. shaver as well as trimmer but battery uses primitive technology. it takes 8 hours to charge fully for 45 mnts of usage. there\\'s no indication of battery percentage. on the unit. i wish instead of their power charging port, they should have provides usb charging port. there\\'s no pouch to carry all tha attachments, charger and the shaver after switching from couple of other products, i am perfectly happy with this one. battery life is amazing. close clean shave with such perfection and really easy to manoeuvre. using this for almost a year now. i can use this for managing my van dyke and for clean smooth shave rest of my facial hair. i have been recommending this to everyone i know. this is a amazing product. very easy to use. you can get a very good quality trim. shaving is also reasonably good.. first time found it little difficult to find the proper angle but nexttime onwards found it easy. little heavier than cheap market products , i guess that is due to battery which lasts much longer than expected.. definitely recommended. i shaved three times after charging for 8 hours, then charging again for 8 hours, not even 15 seconds. please replace it with another item itz very bad product, don\\'t bye it, i got a used product, and not a skin safety, using time skin get injured and setting pain, sounds are crashing and irritable like feeling, little little water are coming in inside, i\\'m really disappointed, i\\'m returning the product... if you see the ratings of this particular product, nearly all the customers have placed 5 stars and i also did the same. the reason is simple, the product is very good and it does the job very efficiently for which it is made. major drawback is that they didn\\'t give you any coupon of 50% off on next blade head replacement. although, this trimmer is awesome. best for those who longed for clean shave with a trimmer but could never get one though. a substitute for trimmer and razor both...they gave it a right name...one blade. no risk of cuts, using water in winters. my brother like it very much. i took it for my brother and guess what he liked it . he has great experience with it .. the quality is good he liked it too much.. battery life is not a issue it\\'s pretty well.. and the good thing about this is he can do both shave and trimming .. thanks to philips the trimmer.is excellent...the cut is fantastic and deep... i have usedany trimmers but this shaves the deep....only disappointment is the charging time...8 hrs is too much... so if u plan to use it, u need to make up ur mind one night prior...8 hrs charging time is too much....but it is waterproof box and product damaged, little crack. and its color faded some sides, it\\'s battery leaks the joint.the seal sticker is opened . please check before send. very easy to handle .there is no problem with blade to skin. smooth shave without irritation. philips has done great work in terms of asthetics. battery life is awesome 👌.. really its worth price.. favorite colour.. more trimming setting has been given.. powerful and sturdy.. trimming power of blades is superb. i bought this item after reading multiple reviews on amazon and doing research. even this was a recommended product from amazon. this was a total disappointment for me, the zero cut is ok, but othersize does not fit well. it’s a scam,. the blade(shaving head) last for 4 months and it costs ₹850/-. the product is available at ₹1750/-. it’s ridiculous that the blade cost so much and the worst part is , it is so delicate that it may break while you use it normal .. i’m sharing the pictures. pretty awesome and affordable product created by philips. it gives a smooth trim without and cuts and it\\'s pretty sleek and comfortable in the hand as well. the product is as good as the norelco series. it\\'s a good buy for the money it is indeed a very nice product from philips. you can use it for trimming as well as for clean shaving your beard and body hair. it is very easy to use & clean. but you have to keep an extra stock of trimmer blade as one blade only lasts for 4 months based on two shaves in a week. nice one. i am an amateur as far as this type of shaver or trimmer usages are concerned.but. i am stumped this is really easy to use and no irritation at all when you shave may it be dry or wet.loved it. worst product ever. you need to replace the blade with one time use itself. blade cost is almost half of product cost. worst product and i just throwed it away as customer care response as well worst.. have chosen this product for this brand but if i would gone for non brand itself the performance is good. i made a big mistake of buying this product. best trimmer for face shaving without any fear of cuts and it is very smooth not found in any shaving trimmer purchased earlier.. i am very much satisfied but replacement of bread is too costly at rs.849/-for 1 blade. with my oneblade it\\'s an awesome precision in your hands. for now all the custom styles can be done at the comfort of my home with an amazing ease.. the product glides so smoothly that you hardly feel anything and yet it achieves a perfect finish. so gone are razor rashes, cuts and bruises. it\\'s time to switch to one blade. i bought this for my dad during the lockdown .nice product. he used 3 no blade to cut hair and it worked well.i didnt expected this but it worked .good for shaving and hair trimming also.but for thin hair . this is not user-friendly. attachment doesn not work properly. you need to put extra effort with attachment. only zero no. without attachment work. those who are thinking for using above zero size hair. don\\'t buy. the best machine ever i used . no any scratches and itching even i have pimples on my face . this is very critical to deal with a pimple while shaving but this solved my prob and also saves my time . i can surely say this is so safe .. also have a nice battry backup.. most amazing part is i can use it even wet face as well as dry.. this tool makes my grooming kit complete.. one blade is a mind blowing product. this is the only affordable trimmer i have found that trims evenly. also lightweight.. con: it has a delicate neck. so be careful never to drop it or neck will break guaranteed. i have bought it thrice for that reason. mind blowing.... we can\\'t imagine this product quality and also performance.... i feel very happy with this trimmer.... thank you amazon... i am using it for clean shave. it is working well. i was earlier using philip\\'s at rotary shaver. in comparison, one blade is working well except at chin and neck. i tried to use trimmer but it did not trim my side burns. i need to check tutorials if i am not doing write. i will write again. i have been using philips trimmers from years, this is the first time i\\'m using such a bad product from philips., the blade become useless after use of just 8 days, sharpness of blades has gone after few days usage, and the blades are too costly.,. kind request to who r going to buy this trimmer, it is better to buy a cheaper one under 400, it ll last more than a month atlest i shave my head frequently to keep a bald look and i have a beard and moustache. i have ordered and tried many but this is by far the best and value for money!. it also is a gentle shaver incase you want to use it on sensitive skin or for elderly people with loose skin. the oneblade is powerful and is providing clean shaves too. when we use the blade to use it as a shaver, it is not at all bad and gives a shave-like look. there are 3 sizes, 1mm, 3 mm & 5mm. the neck of the oneblade is flexible and that helps is trimming the neck and under-jaw regions. philips always full fill their promise and provide us a great products with its their amazing technology...this product also complete in it self.... full out of full well philips is known for its fine quality and let me tell you before this model my brother was using qt4011/15 trimmer from the last 1 year, so now on his birthday i decided to gift him a new upgraded version of this philips series trimmer, so i bought it and gifted to my brother, he really loved it as it has all high upgraded fine features in it. don\\'t order this product... go for regular one.. if you are buying this after watching the images & think you can do it.. then you are expecting too much.. this product doesn\\'t meet expectations. stopped working in 15days.. not meeting expectations. there is no btry indication in trimmer ... it takes too much time to get charged... but. easy to use. gives clean shave. amazing product with some cons i m vry happy with this product.. it\\'s vry esy to use anywhere.. nd vry light weighted ... if u guys want to order this product then hurry up!! i\\'m damm sure about that you\\'ll also satisfied with it like me ... 😍😍 amazing quality. i love the design of this attractive looking trimmer. easy to use and really efficient. much more smoother than the ones i have used before.. this has really solved my one major problem of getting a really good trim with ease at home awesome product easy and comfortable to uselove it .so awesome and best battery life . its blade are blade best for shaving . five star.best battery backup.smooth and long lasting.its handle grip is very nice.best in budget gadget.better than syska.its charger quality is awesome .its look is also good.packaging is good . overall product is very good.if someone wants a good priduct i recommend that please go for it. the product doesn\\'t live up to the philips brands trust and quality.. i have hardly used for 20 times or so. now it stopped getting charged and useless.. how to claim warranty? ( the philips site register product page is not working at all to even register the product ). i buy the trimmer first time after searching on google n seeing some you tube videos i buy it and my decision is right this is the one of the best trimmer it also work as shaver so it\\'s help me alot. exceptionally awesome.... you just don\\'t expect a trimmer to work that good. you can shave with it as clean as with a razor. looks very premium and sturdy. just go for it. worth every penny. mostly i like to do clean shave and finally i get a shaver which does not need to change the blade when i need a different kind of shave, with philips oneblade you can keep clean shave or keep a full grown beard or a french beard, this one blade can do it all easily.. love this such a great product from philips. the main pros are it is easy to handle ,ergonomic , more of a beard styler and trimmer.. cons you get a better shave from other products.battery is a issue.takes 8hours for 45 minutes juice only these are nice clippers and the quality is better than i expected.this is nicely constructed in the handle and there is a well-designed blade and guard retention system.. battery life seems good so far.. overall i am quite happy with the product and would recommend it to others. does what it promises. better than all other stupid trimmers. i\\'m shocked it wasn\\'t released earlier.. ps when using for the first time, use it gently or otherwise you\\'ll cut yourself as this is sharp, unlike other trimmers and shavers it\\'s been a long time i have been looking for something like this to gift my dad,. he liked it and the waterproof blade makes it easy to shave, unlike other trimmers, coated blades protects the skin from getting hurt. a good battery life of 45 minutes overall a good product, the only thing i\\'m worried about is the durability of these blades, once they run out, we need to purchase the blades again. it\\'s performance is not good as phyllis aquatouch trimmer it is unable to clean all hairs precisely during shaving and it is very expensive too because it\\'s blade needs replacement ever after 20 use . it\\'s effortless, styles trims & shaves like a charm & looks super cool while doing it !. love the fact that i didn\\'t have to worry about any scratches / itchiness compared to both trimmers & shavers post a grooming session!. completely safe as it never touches the skin! awesome that it also has wet and dry capabilities!. it feels super premium to hold ! the perfect grooming tool that has ever existed till date! yes..good trimmer. i feel it is not professional. perfectly ok for a quick trim. i like the touch and feel of the product. it is so sleek and fits into my vanity kit along with other items! not a great innovation from philips. trimmer works well but bit suitable for shave. shave is not smooth. i would rather suggest to by only trimmer if someone wants beard trimmer. useless product excellent. i am happy i invested in this shaver. it is easy to use, gives a very clean shave and perfect for achieving a quick shave when i am in a hurry. not that sharp... very time consuming.. got it for my father so that he leaves using the traditional metal one but this takes a lot of time and eventually my father doesn\\'t use it trims, body grooming = 5/4.5. shave= 5/4.. best back up.. aa battery + usb both usages .. very easy to use. tried for tonsure - too much difficult.. moreover it\\'s not a trimmer - it acts like a clean shaving blade - too much pain and itching after completing.. my experience is like i shaved it with a classic blade.. please don\\'t buy prouduct is superb every 4 months once changing blade is not at all good good product .only cons regarding charging time ..u have to charge to 10 hour .and no charging indication .and no battery levl indication..charger will show the light only when shaver is connected to it..so don\\'t get fear of charger is not working . amazing product by philips. awesome battery life and the blade is sharp & smooth. shaving like finish, no need to shave if you have this. but there is no indicator to know remaining battery or charging. bcoz when i checked on philips website, there was shown that the trimmers had battery indicators, but why the one sold here doesn\\'t have any? it\\'s super cool, easy to use, very handy and very likely to safe as it\\'s never touched the skin.. fits in hand perfectly, batter life is good. i\\'ve been using trimmer from different companies lately, but there\\'s none which helps me clean the finest hair and that\\'s where one blade has helped me really charger not found in the box way better than your average indian trimmer. reviewing this after about a few months of usage, no issues to date. charging is fast and long-lasting and trimming is best. can be used for both shave and trimming .it gives a clean shave and a perfect trim .its waterproof too.it can also be used without a shaving cream large battery charge; very slim & convenient to use like a regular blade safety razor; very easy to clean: this is the best all-in-one razor, trimmer & ear/nose hair remover i have seen & used!! really comfortable and easy to use .... gives a really smooth shaving even while dry shaving ....i believe it\\'s better than a normal razor as it can also be used to trimm your beard.. could have included a few more trimming size attachment options i gave this trimmer as a gift to my husband & he totally loved it as it is easy to use & we don\\'t need to charge it for long time as it\\'s battery life is good. good product.. pros: light, handy, easy to operate, good accuracy, smooth operation.. cons: refill cartridge blade when compared with other competent trimmer cum shaver in almost same cost. the product looks and feels very premium right from when you hold it for the first time.. the blad size is small, hence you\\'ll have to give 2-3 wipes at the same place.. but, yes it definitely gives a very clean cut. almost a shave like look.. you\\'ll get used to the blade angles after sometime.. overall, a decent product. product quality is good but it increasing expenses. after using it is observed that you have to buy new blade every 3-4 months depending on your use which will cost you around 900+ if (i trimed 2 times in a month still after vtwo months i have to new blade) you another rs. 400-500/- you will get new trimmer. ordered this as diwali gift for my husband and literally saw his eyes sparkle when he opened this. the product is really easy to use and easy to clean. you can now shape yourself up within the comfort of your home which is really great. it’s also pretty decently priced compared to competition. worst product i have ever brought from amazon. below are the problem areas:. 1. only 3 trimmer comb available.. 2. trimmer gets off automatically while trimming/shaving.. 3. shaving blade is not sharp, it requires multiple attempt to get proper cut.. not worth its cost. extremely useless product. disappointed customer. i just recommended for clean shave. i only use for clean shave and its gives a excellent performance. if u r searching clean shave or giving style to the beard . so i specially recommended u for this product. n talking about charging it took 5 or 15 max to max time to clean shave. so if u charge it one time u can use this for a week without charging again. the one blade wonderful of philip\\'s is not at all good or in,fact i am regretting of buying it. it never gives a close shave and further takes long time as.compared gillete 3blade. even trimming also only 1 m is useful rest are not at all useful. fallen for the much hyped ad of jadeja but turned out to be a total disaster i gift this to my husband he just love this trimmer... it\\'s stylish n technology very gud. look great 👍👍👍. unique in design ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐. excellent 👍👍👍👍. battery life also very gud.. awesome trimmer, it has good battery backup.very easy to use and is very comforatble for trimming beard.very easy to clean...... thanks philips for this product its very easy to use, gives a very close shave it is said oil doesnt mix with water. the same thing applies here. philip shouldn\\'t have combine trimmer with shaver. since going to barber was not possible during lockdown i bought this product but this product has been a big disappointment. it doesn\\'t trim well nor it shave well. total waste of money. i do a lot of impulsive purchasing and this was also one of them....but i am very happy with this purchase.. the razor-like shape gives better control, easy to maneuver looks and feel good. guys do not but this product ! i bought it 2 months ago , used it only once . and when i tried to use it again , it’s blade got broke .. it is no where a quality product .. it is more of a cheap chinese product .. do not but this crap . this is a life saver trimmer/shaver , looks good , works amazing and has a good battery life , it has already saved a lot of money & time as the kind of beard i have it needs a little bit of trimming every 7-10 days with the phillips trimmer i can do it all by myself so no need to visit the salon every week now :). happy customer used it for the first time after ordering it and my skin became red and i have got little boils. do not like the product at all unlike other trimmer this is the best product. works smoothly. battery backup is very good only thing that bothered me was that when i use it on upper neck, it scratches the skin and its painful. i was able to solve it by using the trimmer upside down. that\\'s how i use it now. guys pls do not buy it if you are thinking to use it for at least one year. blade will easily get old and you have to replace it with new one. and new blade comes at a cost of 800 rs. it\\'s really not worthy. everyone spending so much money is not worth unless you are ultra rich. i m repenting after buying it. pls don\\'t commit mistake like me extremely comfortable to use. give you a clean shave( extremely close to a razor shave). charging last long enough for full shave.. trimming combs are precise and come in all the sizes you will need. love the product. u won\\'t need a shaving blade anymore. this trims and shaves too. it charges fast and is pretty compact in comparison to previous philips trimmers. considering the price and vartiey the product provides, it\\'s really a good buy. worst product of philips. every 5 star review here is after using it for like 5 days. and i am writing this review after using it for 6 months. blade is very expensive. 2000 for blade? are you kidding me. you will have to buy trimmer for trimming. it will stuck in your beard and will cause you pain. it not working properly mentioned on the package battery time charged for 45minutes. then i charged to save this shaving trimmer charge use on 5 to 10 minutes. and also mentioned to the buyed this product for 28 july 2020 i am nearly used 3 or 4 times.. kindly replace this trimmer or otherwise refund my money back 1) the plastic combs are too fragile & replacements are also not available.. 2) a suitable hard carry case for the main trimmer & the combs should have been provided for convenience during travels. absolutely waste of money and hype about this product on internet it\\'s clearly meant for one shave or trimming the moving blades are super slim which means that it will worn out quickly and replacement blade is expensive so you won\\'t be able to use like regular trimmers. lightweight, easy to use, clean shave without heart, blade quality is supper, work like charm, adjustment for beard style is easy to change, battery life good, overall excellent product. perfect in terms of quality and performance, although need more clip ons for a variety of beard lengths. tried searching but no other sized clips are available the blade quality is very bad. this is designed for a low up front cost and high maintenance cost. once you buy this product you will have to keep buying the cartridge every few months which is expensive phillips one blade trimmer is the best electric razor available in the market as on date. this chargeable electronic razor with its special effects gives rest to my stubble. and with such clean results also this gives comfort to skin as well. the product is too complicated to use .. i want to return it .... nothing great about this product as it is hyped in the advertising...! amazingly awesome product. buy without hesitation. more than happy with the product. price is above average but if you do the math it is more economical than traditional shaving kit. go fot it. buy it on amazon as in store it is priced at 2699₹ not as shown i presume not all facts are stated ebarative so one won\\'t be able to understand such & has to change the blade in every three months (which was not sustainablly) stated i suppose-advocate d.chatterji 1. battery life is awesome, works for weeks.. 2. for big facial hair it sucks takes a lot of time.. 3. as a styler it\\'s amazing, as a trimmer not very good.. 4. if you keep a stubble it\\'s the product. good one.. pros:. shave and trim very smooth.. easy to wash.. good battery life. very handy.. blade can bend.. material quality very good.. cons:. not useful for hair cut (like how we use old model philips timers for trim the sides). writing this after 2 weeks.. it\\'s a good trimmer with precise cutting without harming the skin or doesn’t causes any cuts or rashes after use. best for the people with sensitive skin . good battery life. it\\'s even good for underarm trimming.. it comes with three attachments of 3 different sizes(1,3,5).. overall experience was great. must buy, this was gift for my husband during time of lockdown. he found it amazing and easy to use.. very effective. clean shave it is comes with the power of style, trim and shave.. having with sharp blades at two sides and easy to rotate our hand to shave and trim the hair.. and it is very easy to use.. the blades are tooo sharp it cut downs hair neatly it look like really shave with lazer blade.. so i loved the product 😍😍😍 on the first shave, the blade suddenly disappeared, meaning it got detached with only half shave done. searched for an hour. couldn\\'t find it. buying a new blade is not an option so soon because they come in pairs and will cost me around rs.1600. 1800 rs wasted. does not give clean shave as traditional razors. need to pass it multiple times. even then, some hairs do not come out and looks bad afterwards. pls avoid. product looks good. but lacks practicality in terms of utility on shaving and trimming. it doesn’t do both in the best way. awesome products good for home purpose battery life is really awesome. clean shaveing is possible in this device. well managed product and good build quality. happy with the purchase! yesterday i have got delivery from amazon delivery is good & performance of philips trimmer is not so good because there is no force to cut the beard hair it is taking too long time use this trimmer ..in this philips trimmer 3mm combo blade is missed when i opened the pack .. please don\\'t buy this product . it gave rashes on skin absolutely not worth it, it cannot cut through if you have a little longer beard, takes 8 hours to charge with run time of 30 minutes, every two months you need to spend another 700 rupees for blade. do not waste your money on this. philips is the beast in trimmer segment. best in class. very easy to use. attractive design. just one point of concern, battery life should be more. the three sizes 1,3 and 5 are that comfortable... it depends on the angle you beard is growing... somewhere the same blade cuts more and somewhere less although i am a big fan of philips products but specifically i would suggest that \"philips one blade\" is the worst product...the quality of the blade is extremely poor it is not even a good trimmer forget about saving...i bought this and within 2 weeks the blade got blunt and the service is extremely poor.. i used this product for the very first time, it is great to use, the edges are very sharp so it takes very less time. the blade is very delicate so you\\'ll have to take utmost care. as for the combs, i think they should have provided a 7mm also and a small brush to clean the areas of the blade difficult to reach. this product don not have the charging indicator- which is very dangerous for battery life and overcharged battery may fail to operate or blow or burst any time ..... very bad product, not to buy this model don\\'t waste your money. it cannot even you a clean shace comparable to the rs 20 gillete blade available in the market.. do note you cannot return this product. also it\\'s blades are quite expensive @ rs 800 and you have to buy it after two months.. so this product is complete waste this is a great product , easy to use, efficient and has 3 benefits, this definitely made lives easier. would highly recommend it to everyone. good trimmer gives shave like feel and available in different comb battery life is good but need 8 hours for full charging excellent product.. everything about it is a pro.. the only con i can think of is that it does not have self-sharpening blade. it needs to be replaced every 6 months based on your need, but it does go on.. it is completely waterproof, used it in shower as well. the trimmer is good. easy to use, easy to cut, easy to handle. battery backup is good. problem is only one: the blades. the blades lost their sharpness only after 3-4 times. the company claims that it works best for 4 months. but i guess, it works good for only 4 shaves. its good, safe and easy, the only drawback is the cost of the blade, which is almost 50% the cost of the whole product. the product is costing around rs. 1950 and cost of the blade is around rs. 850 battery charge retention ability is excellent. usage methods are very simple. overall we are satisfied. the life of blades are very good this product is as useless as a bottle cap of a single use bottle. this product is worse than a local trimmer which is of the price rs 200-500. i highly recommend not to buy this product as i have spent a lot of money on this trimmer . the blade is so useless that u have to change it every 4th to 5th trim. it\\'s quick, and gives you a fairly smooth shave. it looks almost as good as a shave in a barber shop. for best results, use with a shaving foam/cream. when trimmer arrived the package was open and one of the seal of a product was also broken.. but the product is good for now, no issues, good build quality, it’s good to hold, gives you close shave but you have to go against grain. over all product is good you can go for it. it is effortless, easy to use. no scratches or itchiness.. very smooth while shaving and has a very good battery life.. good product to buy.. hilips trimmers and its also very softer than other trimmers....i loved it so much best trimmer in that price. it\\'s has many functions use it dry and wet and easy to use. the saving quality is awesome... i happy the philips comes with new technology all in one blade... but the blade price is little bit higher.. nice one which i buy at a very reasonable price and that too it gives warranty too, very nice build quality and so strong and design is too good. this trimmer is doing great. it i have only had it for a short time but it cuts great with not pulling. the battery backup is good. you can easily clean the trimmer for long life poor quality of blade. never thought a philips product would be so bad, just in a month the blade got teared and now i need to buy a new one .. just pathetic .. blade costs 850 which is very expensive.. very disappointed. go for some other better product ... charging time is pretty much on the higher side.. plus more combs should be provided.. the blade is expensive if purchased separately or whenever you have to buy a new one because the old one has wore out. the quality of this philips trimmer is really osam. u can use it for many purposes like trimming , shaving and also for styleing. it have blades on both side. easy to use and it\\'s battery life is really good it work contentaly 45 mint. it work in wet and dry conditions also. it give three trimming combs u can use according to you need. i can save my time but using it. value of money and time good product ,but not so easy to use .machine fell down on floor and blade got damaged ,rubber support for blade is very brittle ,it will get broken easily and once that happens you hav to buy new blade . i really loved it. it will make daily shavings efforts for an it person to zero. very easy to use. no tension of cut. changing speed is also very good and battery backup is also powerful. the blades are sharp and the head is adjustable according to the area. totally justice to the price osm product. this product is revolutionary because once you buy and use it, you will notice the design is to use as a normal razor, trimmer and for clean shave brilliant for everyday use product is meant for youngsters who want to trim their beard. if you are looking for a replacement of a gillette mach 3 or better product for clean shaves this is not meant for you. does not work good with thick grown up stubbles. after use of two time it\\'s blade become useless. battery 🔋 is very poor ,its work only for five minutes after that its battery 🔋 drain fully. don\\'t buy this .this very costly as per it\\'s price. the product looks very premium and makes sure you are satisfied by it\\'s quality.. i would say it was worth the hype that philips created. a very convenient option to trim hairs. the fastest method too. easily trims beard too. battery life is sufficient to use. the blade changes color when has to be replaced which is a plus point for this. comes very handy too and is travel friendly. one can buy additional blades also online. a total worth it nice trimmer ....but you can\\'t get clean shave using this product as they do promotion in their adds.... every this is good except the packaging. philips should have given something to keep it safely. i had to use a sunglasses cover to keep the product. after trying many products i was able to zero in on this for shaving. little costly. blade cost is high. the worst product i have ever got. takes around 8hrs to charge for 1 hr use. blade become unresponsive very early and while trimming it itches the skin and pull hairs . worst product from philips. and if worst case you are stuck with low battery then you can’t trim it while plugging it in socket it\\'s a little slow compared to a normal trimmer, but it gets the job done and does it really well. it\\'s a little hard to clean aswell but manageable. would not recommend it for other parts of the body other than face.. it\\'s blade plastic is made with very poor material.getting fall down from hand the blade plastic has broken. i purchased this product and delivered on time. date : 09-05-2021. did a clean shave. dry shave i done. it\\'s just perfect. go for it. strongly recommend.. cons : need to change oneblade every 4 months and it costs 800 or above for single blade.. pros : product is awesome in every point. the product is value for money earlier also i used philips trimmer for 4 years and i\\'m sure this will work the same. i brought it for hair cut because of the lock down. when some of hair were struck in the trimmer it stopped, then we need to clean it up first, that is why it\\'s taking too much time. also it doesn\\'t reach in corners of the ear. this product is very bad in quality , within 2 month of purchase it not working properly.. blade quality are very bad . i will return this if i have now option to return.. phillips deny to provide services to my address and provides on nearby. i purchased this product 3 oct 2019, packing is good not great but this hybrid blade is great today i use this first time and it gave me very clean and smooth save so i recommend this product to every one go for it vale for money. overall ok but expensive blade change @ 859 rs per blade costly. philips one blade is an amazing product.it has a long battery life, easy to handle, and smooth on skin.it is accompanied by 3 combs which can you can use as per your need. you can easily clean the blades as well.a perfect trimmer n shaver to suit all your shaving needs worst buy ever... the product which cost 2000 bucks its blade cost 1300. better to buy other product. really disappointed with this product. i think my product has been replaced by a duplicate or old trimmer as the reviews of this product was good. the package was even open at the time of delivery when i asked him to take the package back he said it turned on inside the box so i had to open looks cool while doing it.. love the fact that. didn\\'t have to worry about any scratches / itchiness compared to both trimmers & shavers post a grooming session. completely safe as it never touches the skin it also has wet and dry capabilities! it is a very good trimmer, with very quick and easy shaver install in it. generally these types of two in one product is expensive but this is very cheap . i always prefer to buy these product to all of you philips qp2525/10 oneblade hybrid trimmer and shaver with 3 trimming combs is nice product it very cheap price and very good product. and battery use long time. this product is awesome product to use for daily use. review for product is very good. i am highly satisfied with its result and working. battery life is also too good and it gives highly clean trimming.. just for the seller... bro you didn\\'t filed the gst against this order. tried contacting your company but couldn\\'t connect. please do the needful we need to little hard on your chicks to get cleaner shave. so, if you have sensitive skin then this product is not for you.. provided trimmer is not much of use as they are very smaller is size.. but based on price it may be worth to use. it is an used product....the hair attached to the blade is clearly visible in the photograph. utterly disappointed with the seller.want an exchange immediately or refund the amount. easy to use.. love it at this price its a best trimmer i used .design is so classy & beautiful its dont feel like cheap the quality of blade is also great. easy to use in any direction.battery backup is also good but 2 disappointing things :. 1. to change the blade every 4 months. 2. blade is so small.. even though it works good still these are drawbacks from philips one blade. and replacement blade offer says 50% but i don’t find any offer i’m the website excellent shave, easy to use, no need of water and shaving cream , specially useful in winter\\'s great product from philips.... giving really good & clean shave while using movement from down to up..... washable so very easy to clean....if saving 3-4 times a week then really good bettary performance (reviewing within a month of purchase)....overall just go for it....!!! it gives almost a clean shave. the 1mm attachment is actually not able to cut 2mm also. i wish there was a true 1mm or 0.5 mm performing attachment. gives even trim with absolute ease. trimming combs are quite durable and easy to attach and remove.it is wonderful for sensitive skin, does not cause any cuts or redness at all! philips one blade is a complete and wonderful product. it is two in one. trims off wonderfully plus shaves absolutely clean. easy to manage. can be cleaned quickly. no need to wait in queue in salons. easy when travelling. elegant shape and compact size adds to its. charging facilates to get relieved of battery tension i am amazed with the product, so easy to use while shaving and trimming beard..... it\\'s little bit of sensitive to use as the trimmer is very comfortable and handy.. thanks, philips for amazing me again the oneblade hybrid trimmer is a perfect grooming tool which can meet all your needs!!. the trimmer is neither heavy nor light it\\'s just perfect!. it is also grippy to hold!. and using the trimmer is a very easy task!. thank you philips for bringing the oneblade to india! this is not a shaver but simply a beard trimmer. the ad was misleading. a cheap trick on the part of phillips a company i used to respect for its ethics. once you use it you realise the mistake and then one can’t return a used product. it\\'s awesome for trimming but i things it\\'s quite difficult for foam shaving with lose hands as blade seems to be weak. bought it for my husband he like it but there is one problem when charge it\\'s only showing in the charger not in the reader it\\'s so confusing. it\\'s very easy to use .if you are looking for a reader go for it.. easy to use. nice quality. battery backup is good. but. not for clean shaved very useful as it gives really like shaved effect.. the only problem is the blade ...at this price they should provide 2 blades...as one doesn\\'t last wrong if used often. saving blade is very small it must be bit more in size which will help to cover surface, battery life is very short excepting more stand by time blade is not convenient for the long run as compared to the other trimmer performance base is very low and it is very high in rate to other trimmer. it\\'s better to purchase syska and other brand. i am not satisfied with this product this product is very useful and easy to use. battery life is good. the product box was tampered a bit but its not an issue because the product was not hampered or the seal was not broken. i would recommend this product for daily use. this product is really good. it\\'s easy to use, hassle free handling and it\\'s very easy to clean it. the blade works perfectly well. total value for money. battery life is amazing. love this product and will definitely recommend it to everyone i know. cheap quality break within 2 month. the blade always break no matter how carefully you use it.. i ordered blade 2 times n its run only 2 month, n costing 800 each. i had purchased this item just 2-months before and its not working now....what to do???? the thing which i loved about this product is the battery life.its amazing and much better than any other trimmer.. as it can be use with water it\\'s super easy to clean!. the only problem i think is that if you use it daily you might have to change the blade after two three months which will cost you around 800! very bad for shaving!! it is useless due to return policy!! i cant return it!! no use for me!! purpose defeated!! one of the worst products received from amazon they have sent a broken piece it\\'s blade is seperate from trimmer .... haven\\'t seen such a bad service by amazon and philips.i seek justice in this regard and request replacement as i wish to use the product selected.. it\\'s not like shown in add.. after charging for 8 hours (mentioned on box) the battery completely discharges after 15 to 20 mins.. there is only single blade which becomes of no use after few months.. completely dispointed product it is neighter shave well or trim well. waste of buying. i strongly recommend to not to buy. it is absolutely wonderful to handle and use. a great product by philips. the most important thing here is that the blade runs for 4-5 months and is expensive to repurchase. almost half the price of the product. not a good shaver nor a good trimmer but good if you need in travelling guys the trimmer is good but don\\'t buy it from this seller. earlier i ordered this then there were traces of oil and trimmer was used. now as replacement i received the product, it comes to be a damaged box. it seems that this product is used too.so buy safely. the trimmer doesn\\'t work properly. it does not charge. the trimmer gets spoiled after 1 use. please ban this seller as he is selling fake and counterfeit products if you like it ,then just buy it don\\'t think any more about quality,very good product.but one thing i dont know it is a reason because to change its blade after usage of 6 months it costs 400 rupees ordered this one for the quick trip that i have coming and can really say it’s the best in the market for every thing it does in the best possible way.. small and compact to hold with a solid colourful grip, it reaches the finest hair to make it a clean shave.. surely recommended for the youth. great product. good for trimming, styling. been using it for a few weeks now.. shaver is not that efficient. for bordering your beard or a clean shave, it\\'s takes a lot of time. battery recharge time is an issue with all the phillips trimmers, however, the performance is really reliable and good.. not as precise as a conventional razor, but, also convenient hassle free, and a foam-free easy shave.. worth the money. it is the best trimmer that i have ever used.i am confident to refer this.the things which disappointed me was there is no battery level indicator and charging for 8 hours is too long even though we get only 45 min usage time. blade is not sharp and blade angle also not proper, i used mostly other side of the blade, and not cutting beard/hair properly as hair getting stuck in blade if you have long beard. overall not satisfied and blade cost also high to purchase again. the feel and the quality is excellent used it once and found it easy to use a brand product. so not a worry . the trimmer philips qp2525/10 one blade trimmer was delivered on 15 may2020. it was working.but the equipment is not getting charged.while put on charging no light is shown in the trimmer and no indication of charging.so we are not able to use it. kindly replace the item not for daily shaving. use a razor for quicker results. the sound is irritating while you shave. it is good only for trimming not for shaving. performance is good but blade doesn\\'t last for many shaves. and blades are costly. many other options available the market in this or better price range. i buyed this product and after 15 days when i charged the trimmer the charger was not working.it was damaged. i had already issued under warranty and contacted them so many times but there was no response from the company side as the product is in the warranty period. a very good product from philips. it\\'s very much better than what i had earlier (from philips). good battery life and light weight plus easy to handle. i am using for a month and i would say it shaves very smooth and has very gentle blade which makes so much time to do work if ur alternative day shaver i will suggest this and u may like it also the product fulfills the name which is given to it. one blade does three in one. style, trim and shave. no need to worry about skin cut . it runs smooth over skin. it consists three blades. it gives me style. love it the best thing i like about my philips trimmer is that it is extremely easy to use and gentle on the skin. so simple to clean. the battery life is quiet long which makes it so convenient to carry while travelling. even the blade is still good inspite of using daily for a month. as they mentioned as they delivered. u will have a great shaving experience easy to shave it’s a good product from philips. but the refill blades r too costly i think very delicate.. it broke with normal usage.. very low quality plastic used.. initially was happy with the product.. but no drops nothing.. just while changing the trimmer attachments it broke.. the quality is not as described on the website and it is only useful for clean shave. it\\'s not ideal for trimming, the clips provided for trimming are not useful at all. overall a good product... worth the price.. i\\'ve used it for over a mnth... it takes some getting use too for the finer cut of the beard(when ur styling).. the size five comb attachment is a downer... i don\\'t think many will utilize...as it takes a long time to trim with that... i was bit nervous but i have trust in philips. the product was in good packaging and delivered on time. after charging for a while i used the product. i found it handy and easy to use. no cuts on edges. i believe one of the product i ordered from amazon. not worth the brand name as the blade looses it sharpness after 3rd use. you may realize it, while using that the blade is not trimming your head in the half way. it’s indeed revolutionary technology but for really short use only! the trimmer works really well. once charged can come for 3-4 trimmings. the blade is excellent. very easy to make shapes on the beard, but need little patience.. overall very good product amazing product. if you\\'re looking for either a shaver or a trimmer, this is the product for you. it\\'s really easy on your skin and if you shave against the grain, you\\'ll have perfectly smooth shaved skin. it definitely worth it. they are true to their tag line. ‘it cuts the hair not the skin’. very confirtable, easy to handle razor for all your body hair. i love the product. it gives fine trimming experience without any cuts or bruises.. trimmer as good built but take care while removing and inserting the blade.. i wished one extra blade should have been given considering the price. delivered used product with damaged blade......seal broken with lot of dust..... as it is clearly visible hairs inside the transparent cover and damaged blade.amazon discard the licence of delivering vendor whosoever does such dirty and cheap business. it was a pain carrying around shaver and trimmer separately. this one blade is shaver as well as trimmer. battery recharge fast, time effective. once recharges last upto 3-4 shaves. also its easy to use. replaceable blade make it more economic. travel friendly. working for me. pathetic product! very very delicate... they tried to provide flexibility in the connection between the blade and the trimmer body but that connection is very poor... it broke the second time i went to trim. poor product. not expected from a brand like phillips you need to buy blades after every 3-4 months. it\\'s better to buy some other phillps trimmer where you don\\'t need to pay money after the product purchase. .. note- one blade trimmer blade costs you around rs.700 which doesn\\'t make any sense. small surface area, need a spend a long long time to get a clean shave. back to rotary/foil. got a trimmer what i actually wanted after a good research. has perfect shape of blades for making beard style i want. good product...worthy buying...but one thing i didn\\'t like is how many shaves single blade can work for.... don\\'t know whether we can buy single blade or not this product is suitable for men with vaginas, or lady boys! it does not suit for someone with thick beard, it’s blade doesn’t last long, additional cost just to purchase the blade, which lasts for 3 months product is good. cannot use while charging. repurchase price of blasde is costlier. as per the video provided by company it\\'s a totally misleading since it don\\'t work the way it showed.. the blade are not good and even after 4th it does not clean the shave and hairs are still there... a product which was attracted by commercial video for customers to false play on it overall good but little fragile it stopped working in less than 6 months bought on oct 9th from amazon.. i also bought additional new blade to check if it the blade. no, it was the base machine.. please let me know if their is a chance to exchange ? this is good product for daily use. quick and safe shaving. i am enjoying it. but one thing i must say, please dont compaire shaving with normal blade shaving. this will not give you smooth and silky skin after shaving as normal shaving. an ordinary razor is easier to use than this electric one. however this is a good product when it comes to trimming. best product by philips battery lasts for a month. . very good blade. now gas been a year since i have purchased. excellent product and excellent quality this does not work as shown in the advertisement by phillips. the shave is not smooth. the beard trimming has limited 3 options. as per design and battery life, the philips oneblade is very good. but, the blade doesn\\'t work on thick hair. the blade pulls hair which is very irritating. maybe the blade works good on thin & soft hair but it doesn\\'t worked on mine. the replacement blade costs 2 times the cost of the trimmer !!. ridiculous !!! dislike: battery life, cant shave while charging, takes long to charge. blades are expensive. wastage of money... you have to invest rs.800 for blades in every 3-4 months. blade quality is very soft, if by mistake it gets falls from your hands, it will break and penalised you to buy another blade... very disappointed with blade quality. i bought it recently..... and used it to remove my head hair and removing beard believe me it was awesome..... very easy to use ...best thing is blade can can be used from both side. ...no fear of skin cut..... really worth it to have.... it\\'s a really nice product, shaves cleans and trimmers nicely, but remember you will need to replace each blade every 4 months. this product requires additional blades to change after four uses. and price of the blades is high so avoid this product. the cost of replacement blades is excessive. unless you are maintaining a beard, you may be better off with other philips cordless electric shaver or traditional blades i like the smoothness and it’s easy to use also 45 min usage time is enough all way best product but i didn’t like the execution bcz if u re doing heavy trimming or shaving the hairs will stuck on trimmer every time u trim or shave so take a note of it.. i put in charge from 9am but see till light is not showing!! i am not sure it is charging or not?? please check it that light will why not showing?? after fill charge will show there green light ? like that ?? its not as comfortable as single blade and its not trimmimg uniformly, always i get uneven beard . literally upset product.. best only for those who would like to avoid blade for clean shave. it didn\\'t work for my neck area properly. for the trimming of beard and moustache works just fine. it worked in trimming out any body hair better than expected. this is an expensive product, i had brought during lockdown as a trimmer, however it just does not work.. do not go for this product..... bad battery life. drains faster and takes 08 hours to charge.. doesn\\'t work when u put charger on and try to trim.. trims much cleaner vpared to others. not happy with this product, really very disappointed from amazon service. when i tried to cancel the order customer service representative saying you will get a replacement.. i do not want replacement, pls return your product and reverse my amount. easy to handle. easy to use. clean and smooth shaving. looks amazing. use it in wet or dry. battery life can be better. little but expensive. brush and cover is not provided by philips only blade cover is there it\\'s worst product. i bought this on march 2020. now i am not use it. because the blade rubbed off within a month. battery life is only one time shave. my money waste. now i bought use and throw ready shaver .. don\\'t buy it. battery is good but the slide notch is pathetic just a light slide without pressing button it just slide there n kinda lose slide button waste of money plz don’t but better buy in vijay sales with same price seems like first copy of philips don\\'t buy this stupid thing.... it is not smooth to trim...utter waste of time...takes three times more time to shave.. but can\\'t do it properly.. not useful than a cheap trimmer...can\\'t cut a strong hair...i trapped... don\\'t buy hi the device has stopped charging after few days of use. the initial charge lasted for many days and when i tried to put device on charging it hardly charges for few seconds of use after charging for 8 hours.. please contact me so i can return this device shaving is very very good clean shave but during trimming hair got stuck between blades good battery life. but the blade gets detached even without pressing button. seems loss fit no proper fitting. it\\'s too lose. i would have put on replace or return but i used it after the replacement time had finished. writing this review after using for 4 months.. i bought it for 2000/- rs.. charged it for 9 hours it runs 5-8 minutes only.. one side blade is dead.. range of comb that covers blade is too high. (5 | 10 | 15) it should be like (5 | 8 | 11) mm. overall rating is 2 because there is not enough options for length settings which makes it useless for people who keeps long beard!! a good product. i purchased two weeks back. i am using for head shave. i could shave full head within max 10 min without any irritaion or any reddishness on my head..pros: easy to use.good quality. cons: no bettery charge indicator, blade market price is too high. good shaver product. used for shaving n received favourable results. thanks good for trimming & not for daily shaving. blades are costly but long lasting. not as per expectations! unable to clean the hairs completely. also, restrictions on settings like 0, 1, 3 and 5 mm only. i have been using this trimmer for last 2 months and within 2 months the blade got rough and it\\'s not trimming properly. now i have to buy extra blade which costs 800 bucks and this is a loot. i\\'ll prefer don\\'t buy at this price i bought this for my father. it’s a hassle free and travel friendly trimmer. not with too many attachments and the battery lasts for a good few weeks. as per him it’s affordable and just does the job right. he recommends it. i used to have the qt4011 by philips. it was really easy to use and it could have been cleaned easily. this product has only three trimming length with other usage difficulties. won\\'t recommend this product over other philips trimmers very nice design. i loved this quality and colour.. i have ordered this for my husband not yet used so no idea abt battery life but it looks good n easy to use. blades not easily available and therefore a bad choice if you run out of blades. specially people with thick beards will run out of the blade soon. the trimmer is good but blades are not durable and expensive and you need to replace them in every 2-3 months. so, i would recommend a normal trimmer and a razor instead of this good for clean shave (with very minimal points visible) excellent for 1mm trimmers loved it. battery life yet to check. this is the best shaver available in the market right now. the blade is so smooth and it never cuts you whether you toss it, turn it around your skin..... a great product...... must buy works well. the motor, blades and attachments are all good quality. i use it for my beard and to shave my head. it doesn\\'t pull hairs and cuts very well. best shaver i have owned so far. philips’ hybrid styler is a reasonably priced and adaptable shaver that will give you a decent close shave as well as an even facial hair trim. shame about the battery life, though.just don’t use it if you’re going from full beard to close trim. please help, its not getting charged up. this is the first time the battery got drained. we put it on charging but no light is coming neither its working i\\'ve love the product. only negative thing is packaging was very bad otherwise product was very good. one click start stop option is so awesome...... just simply go for it 🥰❤ i\\'m not satisfied this trimmer,without clips u use total beard is shaving process,with clips hair is not remove clearly,clips fitting is also risk,taking off clips also risk,every four months u change the blade,this is another burden awesome product from philips and amazon too.. fifteen days beard cleared in five minutes and that too as it is blade shaved.. risk free, single handed use with multiple accessories.. love you philips and love you too amazon.. i bought this shaver after lots of research , finally satisfied from this shaver , every men must try this product , one can try many different beard styles , it has nice battery backup and it charges very fast also , finally you must try this trimmer performance is ok but issue is with the blade quality . blade is embedded in plastic body and that got broked while i was removing comb ..and now struggling for ordering again as the coupon code is giving problem . very good product but blades are very pricey philips one blade is the one product you need for all tour beard styling and shaping, works well both for dry shave and wet shaving this product is gud as it is 2 in one shaver and trimmer but when i received it the box was not in good condition it\\'s better if packing is new as it have to b gifted i jst repaired it with cellotape good product i decided not to buy this initially reading the negative reviews but i buy it and it\\'s the best philips product i have used ever.. its very smooth the blade on the skin dosnt itching or i dont even get a cut. i didn\\'t know about the battery life yet but everything else is perfect . best shaving experience . 👌🏻👍🏻 it\\'s been more than a week using this product in comparison to other trimmer it is the best and if we compare this to a razor it\\'s best in that case too it\\'s battery life is amazing, and it\\'s easy to use and you won\\'t get any cut on your face after using it. it\\'s an best trimmer come razor i have used it good trimming for beards good product, as well the nice marketing strategy to retain the customer with recurring purchase of chords or blades, still experienced the smooth trimming, worth of it.. thank you philips and amazon for wonderful delivery... this product is useful for shaving. it takes sometime to get used to it. i am happy to choose it 😊battery life is sufficient for one week. comfortable and easy to use this is something incredible product from philips, it is very durable easy to use, the blade cleans hair so closely and it doesn\\'t hurt, plus it is waterproof so i can use this in shower also. i strongly recommend this trimner. absolutely loved the shape and ergonomics of the product. very easy to hold and glide through all possible curvatures. first use gave a super clean and sharp shave, really happy with it. its a good product but i didn’t like the battery back up, although this is my first trimmer but as a customer i feel so battery is little weak.. over all its an excellent product. good for sensitive skin, you can use it anywhere on the body, but for a clean shave, it would be a waste of money was recommended by a friend, very easy to use does the job efficiently. battery life leave much to be desired & the lack of an indicator means you may be stranded with half a beard, so be mindful. i am not able to trim my beard, and after a year it\\'s not working properly. i bought this for trimming but it\\'s been used for shaving only its very expensive for a trimmer. the blade is not durable and breaks. i had to buy a new one in one month which costs like 800+ bucks, in that money you can literally buy a new trimmer of a different company. not worth it. dont buy it. this is a good product. battery is also running good. overall satisfied. i have purchased it and really loved it a long. great product by philips keeps it up. i am using this for 15 days and, to be frank now i don\\'t need razer and all to make a perfect cut and trim. does its work as it promises however if battery life was better and charging time was less then this product would have been a revolution in the grooming range for men. this is amazing product its very smooth yo use . battery life is also good . very good product just little bit problem in cleaning . money worth product. thanks to philips to create amazing product and also thanx to seller . i have been using the trimmers from different brand lately, but there’s none which helps me clean the finest hair and that’s where one blade has helped me really. product is handy and easy to use. shaving is alright, trimming is not so convenient, stubbles are really small even with 5mm header. battery die after single use, after complete charging of 8 hrs battery is not giving it\\'s performance. highly not recommended to buy it. return window close on amazon. have been using the device since a year and can safely say, amazing quality. i found the simple version of philips trimmer better, this one does not offer anything special. its also difficult to carry three different number attachment, because all three are detachable.. go for the simple version very good and durable product , but it is slightly heavy but i suggest use branded screen guard and back cover to protect 25000 mobile zarala glass is the best screen guard use on m51 costs 500rs and i suggest spigen cover in this lockdown this philips trimmer shaver helped me a lot and the best part it’s handy and long lasting with good results this is an pathetic product by philips. there were times when i used to buy only philips products but this product is really disappointments me because if it\\'s working. i just used it 5-6 times and it\\'s blade indicting to change it and the blades just get blunt. very bad product. the blade doesn\\'t cut hair preciesly... i used just once and it\\'s so irritating... don\\'t buy this product. the clips are just for show up it will not be helpful to get perfect size finally u ll have to shave from shaloon this is nice product for beardo guys,just battery life is somewhat disappointing, also there is no battery level indicator,you can go with the lithium ion version if you want to ,which is just some bucks costly,overall good product. blade doesn\\'t last long.. it is fragile. blade ended up within 6 month . and cost of blade is too high. although smooth in use but too much costly gifted to hubby...clean shave is not satisfactory but ok... very flexible and convenient to use ...you can just set the size and go crazy...no need to be cautious ...you can casually run it up n down ...so far so good the built quality of the product is really good . the button system is also good. the rubberized green colour makes it look more attractive n easy to handle, it doesn\\'t slip from ur hand. we can easily shape and trim our beard. happy with the product. really loved the product.. love the fact it is waterproof (hence easy to clean) and it is effortlessly simple to use.. the only downside is that the blades are pricy but the quality of the product makes up for it superb product. this provide all types shaving without changing blade. highly recommended.. cons: max trimming size attachment is .5 cm.. need higher for bigger beard everything is good .. except idiot manufacture forgot to add led indicator for battery or charging. this was so basic and important thing. also charging takes hours and you can\\'t use it while charging. not worthy. replacement blade is too costly. it works ok as trimmer only. even trimmer sizes are limited to 3 only.. one can\\'t get clean shave after multiple application also.. waste of one\\'s hard earned money. not at all recommended. just after 3rd-time use, the blade got broken. it is made up of very thin plastic and hence very fragile. now i cannot even return the product. the replacement blade costs rs.849/- which is half the price of the product. i purchased for shaving. but the replacement blade is very expensive.. i prefer my old phillips trimmer and mach3 razor. if you are looking for a precise clean shave , you can go for this.i was looking for something like this to compliment by trimmer and refine the edges.. quite satisfied. great product from philips. very easy to use. easy to clean. poor quality product. doesnt work properly. battery stopped charging after using twice. too much hard to use, unable to clean after use. the product is not upto mark its very slow on working , bread style not good with this. wanted to return but amazon is not taking back that item... totally fed up... my hard earned money gone wested... please suggest what to do.... amazing product and worth every cent. wondering whether i may end up even using for trimming my hair after this 21 days lockdown or more in india. brilliant product philps worst product. this trimmer will not help trim your beard at all and if you have thick hair it not work at all.. the blade is very small and light. it can easily broke as well. please do not buy awesome it cuts so smooth and almost looks like its shaved.. but i didnt know how to use the caps but other than that it\\'s the best trimmer and shaving all in one there is no way to find out the battery backup..takes too much time to recharge the device..won\\'t recomend the product. moreover just slipped from hand and broken..don\\'t know what to do now. what rubbish... so many times i said i want return back the item but the end their send their employee at my home with a replace item but so many times i said you i want return that item so finally i said you pl do something..... good product to buy at this price. easy to use product but a bit difficult to clean but worth taking as far as other positive points are concerned. gave it 4 star bcoz it is provided with only 1 blade which work only for 4 to 5 months and according to this 1 blade cost is little bit high. otherwise its a good product🙂😊 the issue is only for a single blade 😠 till now amazing performance. doesn\\'t cut at all.. smooth shave wet or dry. only it lacks is battery indicator as per when it\\'s completely charged. otherwise it\\'s very comfortable the best product i have used till date when it comes to dry shavers and trimmers. surprisingly easy to use. great battery life. easy to use. trimming & shaving both awesome. very good product in terms of ease of handling, and precise trimming. this product is really awesome... perfect battery 🔋 life , around 5 to 6 hours continue,. it\\'s very easy to use and easy to clean. perfect for clean shave. styling with this product requires patience and skills. it\\'s takes very less time for perfect shave. wait for a price drop or discount. go for philip\\'s 3000 series trimmers available for around same price. this product description should mention that it won\\'t have a storage bin so be ready to shave at the wash basin to avoid spilling your mustache hair all over. product is good, only problem is hairs won’t cut completely & 10 its splits the hairs, excellent for trimming only. not good for clean shave.. the trimming is not as fine as expected (as shown in advertisement).. it cannot bring sharp border to your beard or moustache.. not used sufficiently to comment on battery life. stick with philips. huge quality difference between this and other highly rated chinese products. this is very a very versatile device. its really working good and battery backup also very well . upto now no issue found ,great product .thanks to philips. one of the best trimmer ever used really very smooth. love it! i have to change my review.. i used it and within 3 months blade is broken and new blade is highly priced.. beware of using it. you buy it and suffer like me. it is friendly suggestion. very easy to use. gives and extremely smooth shave. the rubber part connecting the blade &the main unit is very fragile & got broke off. i had used a different product of philips, nt9 145/1435 it was quite ok. this product is awesome.. worth buy it but the replacement blade of this trimmer is costly. u can found it at philips website. think before buying it. cant believe that the blade was broken in just 2 months and important to add that i hardly used it 4-5 times... very poor product. this was my 3rd trimmer from phillips and this one is poorest. shaves well and clean like razor blade. use carefully and smoothly near groin area.. recommended !!!!! this product is good but not suitable for clean shaving. if you are looking for phillips trimmer for clean shave it is not good. it is an amazing product, extremely good results when use with shaving form, easy to handle, good battery backup, overall it is a good product worthwhile in this price. mind-blowing product from philips.. great trimming experience.. 4 star because, you have to change the \"one blade\" after 4 month of use.. definately value for money. 👍 the blade has to be replaced every 4 months and a blade costs about 900 rupees which is a lot of money. one could buy other models of trimmer for that price and use for years. this is a waste of money. it\\'s effortless, styles trims & shaves. it is very easy to use, i didn\\'t have to worry about any scratches compared to both trimmers & shavers.. it feels super premium to hold ! it is better than other products, performance on shaving blade is not at all as expected . though the promos claim it works well with foam as well but does not give a smooth shave at all . had to resort to old gillette for the smooth shave . besides no return policy only replacement . disappointed by the product for sure इस प्रोडक्ट में हमे बेट्री लाइफ थोड़ी कम है और बाकी पफॉमेंश ठीक है लेकिन सबसे बड़ी दिक्कत चार महीने में ब्लेड बदलना ऐ सबसे बड़ी दिक्कत है बाकी सब ठीक है does the job and good for delicate parts of body. it\\'s really a good product. it\\'s works with and even without the application of shaving foam. it\\'s one blade technology keeps the skin safe from cuts. it can be used for trimming, styling and shaving. purchased by mistake. it is for those who do not want close shave. i am unable to make out whether the product is fully charged or not. there is no battery indication on the product. an amazing product by philips. a light weight product. easy to use. battery life is too long. a perfect product for daily use. its shape it much batter than any other. i recommend everyone to use this product once. really its fantastic product. it\\'s easy to use, and has a preety good battery life. i gifted my brother this on his birthday and he liked it a lot. i think you should get this if it\\'s your first razor. the product is very comfortable to use. it\\'s a perfect product for everyday shaving. the trimming capability of the product is also not bad. the battery life is very good. philips trimmer acha qanaty hain magar change hone ka liye bhut der hona hain battery indicator nahi hain quick charge nahi hain our uska balls bhut mahag hain 800 rs midal calls admi ko nahi parvdta for shawing purpose it\\'s good, but there bettey trimmers of philips in the same range of amount.... the worst trimmer i have ever seen.. it is like a normal trimmer. no manufacturing defect.... only thing is... need to plug 3 blades and need to repeat 5 times on the same place to remove hairs.... worrrrsssssstttttt its essier tobuse gillette disposable razor and get mych smoother shave. and mych cheaper. philips oneblade is so smooth and gentle in use.the best trimmer i ever had,very well structured and also i love the colour.design and functions are so amazing.and the best thing is you can us it wet or dry or even in shower. 1. the product looks great in style and feel. 2. the 3 in 1 process is great that is trimming and shaving, styling. 3. the battery life is good, goes for 2-3 days. 4. good to have for long beard. 5. comes with attachments for styling don\\'t give a taught.. if you planning to use it for zero number its a deal breaker but don\\'t expect too much after using comb attachment. and also doesn\\'t hurt anywhere. you can use it as you want. wonderful product from philips, easy to use. fully satisfied, love the color of trimmer. very nice 👌👌👌👍👍👍. good service by amazon.. thanks it is good, go for it. if possible buy form local store - no battery indicator. - takes too much time then other trimmers. - needs 8 hours to get fully charged and gives only 40 minutes backup not as good as shown in the product video. takes a lot of time than a traditional shaving. the only advantage is that, it is safe to handle and requires no shaving foam. otherwise a lot of effort. battery is not getting charged..it\\'s 10 th day...return window got closed...unfortunately i got a defective piece from philips for the second time...there is no philips service centre near me...what to do.. this is just ok as a clipper . you can’t use it for a regular shave. its very delicate ,and by mistake fallen from my hand and the blade got broken.now if you buy the blade which is almost half of the total cost.which is very expensive.in that price of blade you can buy other trimmer. great engineering and awesome feel .. should have one extra blade in packet. nice product. long battery life.. as i trim once in a week so in one charge it goes up-to 20-25 days. or 30 minutes continuously very easy to use and extremely soft on the skin you should definitely have this product in your list. very easy to use but a bit delicate.. according to me it is the best among the competition.. this product is worth buying👍👌😁 not worth buying! does not give a clean shave! not recommended for hair trimming, trims uneven,ok battery drains fast, for shaving razor is still the winner. it is easy to use and clean and the attachment trims the beard with ease no irritation or itching as compare to normal shaving. you can use the same with shaving foam, cream etc or without them. the point is the blade is not for hard beard.. it works like a 30 rupees rajor. i loved it but charging time is very long.. esle everything is great. go for it!! i got this product in 2050 rupees and totally satisfied with this.. thus best thing is that it gives u a \"clean shave look\" which a normal treamer can\\'t. class apart super soft and cuts even the smallest strand of beard. clean exp excellent product. of late, philips is producing excellent items, it is one of them. it doest not provide a shave as close as a cartridge razor would. it cuts around my jawline very often. instead of this shaver go for a braun or higher in phillips shaving range. although it is easy to use and is totally waterproof so that\\'s a plus point. a easy use trimmer, only for beard trimming. batter life is awesome. doesn\\'t do well with dense hair. even dense beard is hard to clear.. cleaning is hard.. thanks i have got a coupon in the box sign up and get 50% off a replacement blade 2 pack but how and cost etc easy to use and clean...good battery life....so far so good.... amazing trimmer. this trimmer so smooth and very easy to use. i used for trimming and clean shave also. battery life is so good. and the brand philips is coming up with amazing product. so good to use this trimmer not a worth buying. the machine does not do the job as portrayed. the blade got blunt in a lesser time / instances used than mentioned.. hence not a worth buying. one of the best trimmer.u can have almost clean shave with it.only one request- if phillips can add a led light as a charging indicator,then it will be more handy.and yes one more comb of 7mm positives. 1. easy to use. 2. easy to carry anywhere.. 3. washable.. negatives. 1. does not give you clean shave.. 2. it\\'s charger does not get attached properly with the charging point or board. the trimmer is all fine but the major and big drawback is you have to change the blade and it will cost 850 inr for ine blade. this is the reason i have given two stars the product is very good and easy to use. is a good product by phillips. easy to use but one thing that no indication of the battery. the blade is very delicate so please use it carefully, overall the product is nice i\\'ve 4.5 stars for this one blade. we didn\\'t need to charge in the initial period of return days. when we tried charging later it is not charging. am surprised how such a new item can be so faulty. it is an awesome product in this range \"elegance look, nice grip good battery life\" i bought it for my husband & this is what he commented excellent trimmer it works more than expectations great experience the changing of clip is little hectic but it is okay !!. great product overall! all 3 blades are useful. easy to use. good battery life. good grip. perfect for long as well as short beard not so convenient in using. shave does not come smooth and clean. hairs around neck and below cheek does not shave cleanly. lot of irritation occurs after shave specially on the neck part. waste purchase simple razor works better than this. not at all easy to handle. i purchased based on the ratings but it was disappointment. their is no way to know if your shaver is charged i thought philips is the best brand, but after receiving this product, in first use itself, blade started wobbling. it is making awful sound and blade does not stay stable.. do not recommend such product. my g son ordered it -i hope he likes it its really good. able to do clean shave. product is expensive as per its quality.. take care of the blade bcz if you drop it accidentally the blade would be broken... bt the shaving experience is luxurious good product but need to buy blades sapere blade\\'s are more costly than trimmer kind of ok... not really a shaver though.. but yes can be used for grown up beard seems good..battery life nd ither issues will surface after use easy to use,clean,shave. you should go for it ... good product woth buying this product but it is bit expensive and the quality is awesome. takes too much effort to use man! have to press to much to trim every hair. totally unimpressed by this product i am able to clean my body like never before this is a lovely product. the beard styles you can achieve through one blade is great. a little bit of creativity will make you a step ahead of your regular hair stylist or barber. no compromise in quality and handling. don\\'t buy, won\\'t find replacement blades delicate metirial life nice product easy to use and easy to clean time saving so nice i\\'m giving to gift my husband this doesn\\'t provide a close shave as you experience with a gillette fusion set. for trimming it works well on your beard. the article is expensive, when you talk about the life after the blade is old this is where you will realise that replacing the blade is expensive buying anew trimmer is cheap maintenance will be little bit expansive but worth it every single penny.. battery life is fairly good. the small blade portion and square edge makes thing easy. not recommended for heavy duty. note that the blade needs to be bought separately after few uses. this product is good but this trimmer blade get broke after 2 months probably the best electric shaver i have ever used in india. third class product don\\'t buy it product matched with web credentials.....nice after two charges it needs charge after every shave. whereas the specs said that one charge will last for 45 minutes of use. it gets completely dischrged in 10 minutes of use. great product. my only disappointment with philips is they sent one promo code by mail that promised 50% off on blade at amazon but that was not accepted by amazon! totaly waste of money..... not work properly, only work with combs.... takes too much time to cut beard properly.... don\\'t buy this trimmer... it was written on the package as saying 3 trimming combs but there were only 2 combs inside, however its a good product, will be greatly helpful in my travels. not soo much things it is definitely go to buy trimmer also a shaver❤❤ the best from phillips. shaves perfectly whether it\\'s a dry or wet shave. my skin is very sensitive but still there are no after shave burns. it\\'s smooth as a normal trimmer. does an excellent job in shaving clean and neatly. average performance with company name. expect superiority with pricing.. shall review blade pricing since blade doesn\\'t perform as expected or as advertised.. cio its head needs to replaced very often . u will be happy only in starting then it seems to be less precise .. and its head is very delicate, if u push it bit hard against skin, it will break apart . the sharpness of the blade lasted for 3 months.. the blade broke in 5 months. over all nice product happy to use it. the priduct is enclosed along with an offer to register and get 50% discount offer for buying one blade spare replacement blades but the registration site not responding. i would say its very good to use for shaving, trimming and all. but the price is high according to the product. would rate it as a good body and beard trimmer but if u r looking for a clean shave, i did not find it even close.. multiple attempts leaves skin irritated but doesn\\'t give a good shave. excellent product awesome product it does the job with ease and also very sharp blades help to trim my beard in desired shape . it\\'s an excellent product by philips. it\\'s easy to use. easy to clean . 1. does not give a close shave.. 2. no light to indicate the charging process. 3. the logo etc on the one i received seems a bit rubbed off. is this a used piece? first trim using the trimmer...i m quite impressed with the number 3 comb which i used. good product, easy to handling and smooth. received used product. super and smoothly use for trimming and shaving .. it is using to easy. i product is super.. i like the product.. all are want to buy.. thank you.. battery life---4.. using---5.. clean----5 a great product. gives really smooth shave. go for it. this product is for people who hate traditional shaving but want smooth skin in few minutes. awsome product the 3 inch comb set got damaged in 2 usages up on asking service center they charge 280 rs of 1 3 inch comb the product itself 1300 rs pathetic very easy to use and efficient. it is an easy to use nice product. but very bad packaging and no cover or pouch provided to carry the product on tours. good product , easy to clean & usage but battery life is not pretty good as we need to charge up to 8 hours to usage of 45 mins. and blade also has to change in the time of 6 months span. have to struggle for clean shave it\\'s damage my skin .. not suit for shaving for me and not return option only replacement .. just waste of 1940 amount useless. does not work for hard to medium beard. useless product. nice packing and amazing product must buy good product. lasting battery, sufficient for beard shaving and scalp trimming after 8hours of charging.. sturdy grip, water resistance is good. very costly when compared with blade price and it\\'s life using philips trimmer is a great experience if you want effortless trimming. its easy to use and soo smooth. if i talk about battery life its the best trimmer i have ever used. cleaning is also very easy.i love this product bestr trimmer/shaver ... value for money go for it ,. efficient and easy to use , smooth glides simply flexiable.....like me yeh nice product, value for money blade is very sharp.give clean shave.battery last for 1hour. this is the product for which i was looking for since last long time. perfect. item doesn’t have longitivtiy and durability for thick beard good product compare to mi trimmer. it\\'s gives zero shave happy for buying. but the blades has to be changed once in 4 months. excellent product and easy to use, it’s actually performed well when use in reverse direction as per regular razor . blade is not properly removing the dense hair. i used it for only 5 times. now its working. can anybody suggest how to repair it or change to some other trimmer from the same company. i think this is a very bad product made by philips. bolde life is very less after 3- 4 shave blade not working properly and new blade price is too high. i\\'m not recommended to anyone there\\'s no battery backup of 45 mins as claimed by phillips. even after charging for long time it lasts for 3 minutes. buying electronics from amazon has proved to be wrong decision. just 1 drawback:. there is no battery life indicator.. overall the product is perfect for beard grooming precision. except for battery life which i think needs to improve otherwise good product overall the product is good.. excellent shaver. pros.. 1. gives a smooth shave.. 2. multidirectional use. cons.. 1. not very easy to clean.. 2. average battery life product stopped working after 1 month. very bad quality it is very useful product for me i was looking for a trimmer, shaver and style and i got it finally one blade for all your needs plus easy to use and handle sir the battery backup is worst ever product, it\\'s gets off within few 5 minutes, as it was promised to work for 90 minutes , i don\\'t recommend this product to anyone plzz donot go for new revolutionary trimmer. i faced blade problem in just 2 week it’s a great product for those who don’t want to use razors & also need trimmed beard. regular trimmers are a pain to use. but this one is super comfortable, this the best trimmer i have ever used if anyone using traditional electric shaver then don\\'t expect same from this item no charging indicator and time required to charge is 8 hours is too much for 45 min use. during electric shutdown it\\'s highly impossible, so returning... such a nice product for daily routine life of a man. it is a combine product and gives trimming and shaving. nice battery life and promise from philips brand. it\\'s quality working really faster than others and also not feeling any redness or pain after using it. very good, worth it\\'s cost good product.. good design ,nice and solid.. 9hours for a full charge is a bit more time consuming. you will get a shave almost say like 12 hrs post shaving with razor. good one. no cuts, no special care. good to carry with you anywhere. the product is not at all a good product, waste of money, no where matching to the pictures shown at this price it\\'s a steal and performance is par excellence. battery capacity is good ,easy use and clean poor product. after one year of use ....there is problem with charging....not withstanding more than minutes. blade quality is also worst. excellent product. must buy the received trimmer is already used by someone still minute hairs are present in it. with some scratches over the top. worst response for the placed order. please check soon after buying.. this is a new technology and it gives safe and smooth shaving and trimming. this is the best trimmer i used ever. cuts hair with precision and is easy to handle. good part is that it can be used without the fear of getting you skin in the blades. good one but limeted with combs it\\'s very very flimsy. it fell into the washbasin and broke :((( and when i sent it to the service centre thy couldn\\'t repair it. they didn\\'t even have the parts.. id never buy it again with a surprising battery life and easy to use grip sytem. it is high quality product. cleaning is kind of easy as well. one of the best device for grooming... multipurpose easy to use and very adaptable to any type of styling needs.. office, night out or any other occasion. this is by the far the best trimmer cum shaver i have used. it is much easier to operate and also cutting of the beard is really really smooth. good on don\\'t buy, blade life is too short.. and it is costly.. if you calculate then you will found that it is too much costly very good very easy to use blade automatically come\\'s out when you shave.. charging issues are there. it is superb treamer shaver everything you are suppose to have. really good work and effort by philips. a must have device who always like to be groomed. provides shave closer than other trimmers (can say razor like) good zero trimming, light weight but very delicate, as in first fall trimmer head connector broke and replacement blade is very costly a very satisfying product. i have been using this for dialy shaving purpose from last 3 months nad i have got vwry satisfy results i brought this on august of 2019. now both battery and charger are damaged. and even cant replace the battery as its not available in market. i used to get clean shaved in every two weeks. the picture shows 3 combs. the pack also mentions 3 trimming combs. i hv not opened the pack are the combs packed out of eyesight. kindly note i love this trimmer. shaver is works brilliantly. it has all the features that i was looking for. totally worth buying. build quality is very good as well. very nice grip. and you can use it under shower too. i wish they would have provided carry case or pouch. it\\'s worth the money. easy to use. i bought it for my dad and he is happy with it. it doesn\\'t give close shave and you have sahave same place three or four times, takes longer time than an ordinary rajor shave, charging time is too much, you wont enjoy shaving with this product was substandard. i had complained the next day for return but nobody picked up till date. superior quality, excellent battery easy to hold and use. best part it is washable❤️. one blade is an amazing innovation by philips. value for money product dislike very bad product got defective in 1 month i used it for a day it\\'s very easy to shave and trim and style ur beard. i recommend to buy it. different clips given to trim, but not worthable to shave.. 0 shave is only works. trimmer point is very delicate.. not liquid or brush to clean for trimmer. i got a good experience while using it. but within 7 months the battery works only for 1 shave. also the blade joints made of rubber are written out i used it for trimming and shaving once in 4 days. the trimmer is a good product. the only thing is that the blade is a bit expensive and no brush has been provided to clean the trimmer. when i opened the box i found the blade was already in damaged condition, one side was completely damaged and it seems like someone has opened the box and used.. it seems like usable product. it shave not as close as gillete proglide but it best as it`s category. easy to use nice product i find this philips oneblade amazing product.. for my busy schedule, i wanted a product which saves my time and easy to use. कॉस्ट के हिसाब से अच्छा नही है, ब्लेड बहुत महंगे है और जल्दी धार खराब हो जाती है. इस हिसाब से बेकार है, कोई लोकल सस्ता ब्राड में फायदा है one of the best product for setting ur beard and moustache as per ur wish without going to saloon and spending ur precious money every time....easy to use... dear sir,. there is a small size of razor blade, it\\'s taking time of upto 25minutes to shave.. this is shaved only surface bu not to deep shave.these are the points to negative. i could use this timmer only for two saves it\\'s blade broken .बेकार है। yes it shaves !! smooth like a regular blade ! smooth for skin no itching,. very easy to operate, less vibration and noise, it csn clean easily, clean shave as razor,. great one, but no battery backup and can\\'t use it as a cord while charging pros:. 1) light weight. 2) can be used at sensitive places. 3) can be used as shaver and trimmer. 4) not expensive. cons: can\\'t think of any at this price. no clean shave and blade sharpness in just 2 uses easy n portable the product is good, value for money product is designed to make money off of you. don\\'t buy. battery life is nothing. very fragile...it was falling off while shaving. disappointed in just one day. rather burn your money. this is a garbage product. doest not shave cleanly. over priced. it\\'s just a mere trimmer. i returned back, as low battery backup. you need to charge it for 7-8 hrs for 45 mins uses...where as fast charging facility is available in market excellent. one of the best products i have purchased recently. it is a wonderful product ! philip\\'s is philip\\'s.. highly recommended for those who want to shave for office formal look and also want to trim for styling for a modern look. this product suffices both i liked the finish after using this trimmer. the accessories provided are exactly suitable for all possible trims. overall a good product. worst trimmer i have ever bought. battery get discharge very soon and even the trimmer functionality is worst. please guyz don’t waste your money buying it. defect product was delivered. with amazon i had such experience multiple times. it gives me an impression that amazon is not so serious about product quality and customer sensitivity. one of the third class product i have ever seen. waste of money. not even used twice. to shave, have to move blade in same patch for more than 10 times. no clean shave post that also. i liked the product battery works only for 10 to 15 minutes max. which is not enough as the company claims that battery works for 30 to 45 minutes. sometimes you can’t complete your full shave. it\\'s not good enough for trimming. not useful for clean shave! the earlier version of phiilps trimmer were much better then the current philips qp2525 as this version doesn\\'t trim the hair and it create rashes on skin it stopped working after 1 use. it’s better life is very bad. you need to recharge twice to complete one shave. i think it has to do with seller. this seller is selling used product. over all a good product but the battery should have lasted for long which can sustain power cuts. and secondly need to keep on pluged in for long in order to charge the battery full. product is good for trimming.however when blade breaks down,another blade costs around rs 700 which is very expensive.moreover clean shave is not feasible with it. gave me the style i wanted :) ok but thick hairs not cut properly product is good but the finish is not good because the no indication while charging. it doesn\\'t trim/shave properly, still we need to us the shaving razor to finish the shaving properly. blades are also so costly. it will not work if beard is long and cleaning is a hassle. every time you have to stop and clean manually.. for me wastage of money blade is so fragile and broke after 5 trims. useless product. stay away. complete disappointment from such a reputed brand like philips. planning to ask for a return best trimmer i have used. philip\\'s is always best provider of trimmee awesome every thing is good, bt the charging capacity is low. now a days i charged it for nearly 30min bt it only runs for 8-10min..( that i didn\\'t like it).... or else every thing is good if it is usb charged then it is the best. 8 hrs charging is something worthy. just connecting to a power bank and shaving type is good. blades..are bit costly...with.price of a 2 blades you can buy a new philip\\'s trimmer...but..the..product is good.better..time saving than a normal shave very expensive but it do not work extraordinary than cheaper ones available in market, even of same brand it\\'s a very nice product...... it will give you a very smooth experience with trimming..... worth the price obviously nice product. easy to use. value for money. multipurpose product at a reasonable price. will suggest the combo rather than standalone product. not as smooth as a razor! still a good product for those who don\\'t wanna use the razor.. for every razor stroke, you may need 2 or 3 stokes for shaving (without foam).. still, it works well! very nice product and must buy without any second thought. the quality of product is poor after some time the head wii be broke because of cheep quality and you have to buy another head my husband brought this , he had to later on but another one from philips as this one shaved really close to skin causing him pimples and acne problems power full motor.. precise blades , gives a very precise trim.. no battery indicator may prove a problem sometimes.. bit difficult to clean the blade. have to spend a lot of time. not a great product unlike other phillips shavers/trimmers i’ve used before i have ordered this for travelling purpose as i travelled very fequently and i think this ll perfectly work... i have used just once and really happy with the result.. leaves no hair behind.. it is compact and easy to carry.. within one year, product has been stopped to work. trying to charge but it\\'s not charging..pls accept return or exchange request.. the support of flexible blade is of very delicate... the part has broken within 4 months of use. very disappointed. i love it protects skin and can use 3 times fully charged very good shaver plus trimmer product from house of philips. within 2 months the blade came out.cant complain...is this produce without warranty. .i am shocked at the behaviour of philips and amazon.the customer care does not respond. i didn\\'t buy it as a replacement to a razor, so am more than happy with what i got. it allows me to do everything i imagined. trim n shape your beared and moustache just the way you want it to!! guys please let me know can i purchase the combs for my trimmer?. i lost them while house cleaning.... yoyr help will be truly appreciated...🙂 product was excellent packaging was little bit damaged but product is secured philips need to work on charging time when we charging for 8 hours then it gives 45 minutes of battery life easy to use. does not hurt the skin at all. the blades are easy to remove, change and clean.. yet to see how long the battery lasts. grt experience excellent product very good replacement fir regular blade shave. only thing need extra blade with the packaging. i will give 5 🌟 star buy if u are looking for a smooth non irritating shave. it just does not trim it shaves.. the body is long term use but the blade isn\\'t it needs to be changed once in 4 months it is pretty expensive too. it\\'s smooth and easy to use .. very good product this is the worst trimmer..very difficult to use.. if your normal trimmer takes 5 minutes to trim this one will take 15 minutes. may be the worst among philips trimmers within 3 cycle usage battery backup became not even one minute. class product this is good product . the product is not charging and i need replacement on the product i bought it on 3rd sept battery backup is very poor. don\\'t buy this product i just received this pc.. but confused....? good excellent one! but the blade price is expensive to replace i will rename it from one touch to magic touch. it\\'s best overall. it is a dead weight now. surprised that the battery conked after just 2 or 3 charge-discharge cycles it does its job fine. but maintanence is heavy. please buy a cheaper one. not good for indian market its a very nice device and very easy to use.. thanks to the amazon and their team,for delivering me the same in this covid 19, situation. nice product i bought the phillip\\'s one blade, its very useful for all mens, and very easy to use also... first of all i am thank to phillips... its battery life also very good... its very easy to handle and its giving perfect shave.. product quality is good but using is not that much comfortable to compare to other products of same manufacturer. blade cleaning tool is not provided and we cannot clean it using water because beard hair getting stuck on blades i was dissatisfied with this shaver right since the first shave. it felt pinchy while shaving and gave a patchy shave at best.. this is by far the worst shaver i have used. good product.but only blade cost very high. moreover product is very nice.. i like the product an is easy to use also the motor is much more powerful, use it as a trimmer as well as a shaver, with cream without cream doesn\\'t matter. could have quick charge option it takes eight hours charge time to use for 45 minutes never buy this, useless blade, the blade surrounded by plastic, cheap plastic,plastic broke on my second shave, hard earned money foiled. pls dont buy this product nice product user friendly only 3 to 4 times use single blade so it\\'s very costly in daily use as trimmer and battery life after full charge 30 minutes maximum so not worth product nice,easy, superb, fast, just blades are little expensive when ordered goods are not received as per declared content. it is highly dissappointing to buyer. 2 combs were missing in the product and it looked like used one awesome 👍 worth of money,it\\'s work on skin like butter smoothness of this trimmer is unspeakable. oneblade is awesome. the one blade is awesome. the downside is the blade needs to be changed every 5 months. now that\\'s something if i had known, i wouldn\\'t have bought it. i wanted a clipper. trust me its the best trinmer one can get for money. no cuts no pain works everywhere in the body amazing qualities and perfect style maker good product.. easy to use. value for money. gifted this to my brought who has just turned 20. i can definitely say he was very happy and thrilled to receive the same as it is very easy to use rather than the conventional method of shaving. nice product pathetic ... don\\'t know amazon clearing it\\'s old stock or philips but very poor product replaced product three times same battery problem... immediate discharging...!!!! very easy to shave and trimm good awesome product. completely worth it. if you want clean shave but without shaving then this product is for you skin cuta free product blade is not durable. after 3 month it is not working properly.. it pain your beard while shaving.. and the price of blade is also so high. this is really a gillette killer out there.. the blade last long and no allergies or itching. the best thing is even the dry shave gives a clean look. excellent product for both clean shave or trimming. nice one soo easy to use had a great exp while using it like:. best trimming device ever. the best a man can get.. dislike: you have to change blade. the ones which k have used earlier did not require to change blade. battery life is good and easy to use. we can trim style and shave. water proof is the advantage in this . works like a charm .. looks like refurbished product. the printing shown in my picture is dull. some letters are already gone. seems someone replaced fresh product with used product amazing product by philips i\\'m going to saloon for shave and spents 100₹ for shave only when i see this immediately i ordered it and it\\'s worth it give me close shave like i do shave with blade. easy to use. trims and shaves perfectly. battery life is very limited considering that we are charging it for 8hrs.. good product. really awesome simply super and easy to use. good product i preferd this this is the worst of the worst trimmers i have ever seen nothing to dislike as yet but providing an extra blade would be great better than my old trimmer, overall it\\'s a good product. avarage don’t buy from this seller. the product is already non functional every thing is good but some people\\'s review\\'s frightening me... it’s a gift for those who have hard beard. simple to use even if you messy beard.. gives you smooth, clean and close shave like trim.. after a long time i have really found a good product. it is good in battery life endurance,easy to use and easy to clean the equipment i think every man shd have one. easy to use, no rashes after using. good battery life. highly recommended excellent product. please don\\'t buy this product as the life of blade and battery of this product is very poor. i always wanted this trimmer from past 1 year .now i got it . i love it . it so easy to use . machine blade defective . i have done many order in amazon but amazon disappointing me and i m also amazon prime customer easy to use but battery life is too short need 8 hours of charging and only gives you a 45 minutes of use. poor in battery life. but easy to handle , easy to clean 🙄 blades are really small in size and does not upto the mark. it\\'s useless and totally waste of money. pls refund my amount. shaving is not as good as rajors. but that is expected. no complaints as of now. gr8 product. easy to use. totally satisfied for now. battery backup and cleanability needs to be further assessed. product is wonderful, one of the best. using the same from past one month. bought a new one today to gift broter. value for money. essy to use & clean, battery back-up is very good. almost get clean shave. nice product 👌 , very fast delivery 👌 but packings aren\\'t good.. otherwise product is awesome ... super easy to use the blade very fragile. it broken after 3rd use. and now if you buy new blade it will cost you around 850. i do not recommend to buy this. best product bad product by philips not worth it for money.... you\\'ll have to replace blade every 4-5 months blade cost 800/blade.... so it will be a expensive deal for u it’s easy to clean and easy to use.. it comes with attachments for 1,3 and 5 mm beard size.. it’s overall a good beard trimmer but not meant for clean shave. it\\'s a good product for me i just shaved my breard with that trimmer the blade is powerful the body with the blade is also good i loved it. i hate epilators and thisbcame as a blessing. easy to use and clean. good good easy to use the product is good... but the shaving is not clean. prefer razor (mach 3) is best. battery life is very low . some time it will stop while using . you can not use this while charging . changing time is very high. above good trimmer is indeedbut shaver is not i wanted to buy a combo to remove my white beard hairs as well as to trim the rest.works perfectly i surely need a professional for all the stuff shown on the television adds....good for direct shave...!! the delivery came on time. the package had already been opened and re sealed with tape. also the hint of a few strands of hair implies somebody had tried to use it. not expected. best trimer and shever i have used. good to use for regular i like the product a lot .. very good trimer, easy-to-use, i used for clean shave, very smooth easy and good batter backup. needed a trimmer.only.for my 17 year old son.. don\\'t need replacement but another model if only it had more length options, and forever lasting blade, it would have been perfect! still worth buying and better than almost all trimming/shaving products. easy to use and easy to clean but battery power is low and seems to be costly enough for these features. good it\\'s a nice product for traiming and shaving very fragile product blade breaks easily and then the product is of no use when i am buying this produce, it is easy to use and easy to clean, battery back is good, i have 03 coombs, its uses to setting our beard shape. ok not bad, better one not so great to give clear hair line everything else just works perfect 3 stars because they are not providing extra blades. at least one extra blade they should have provided. good innovation got spoilt very quickly. it starts and stops immediately, probably a battery issue . i am happy to receive such a good product in the middle of lockdown. total failure when to comes to clean shave and hair trimming/ cutting. maybe designed only for beard trimming this is a fresh new shaver for me. easy on my beard, i dont have to be worried about a beard hair getting stuck in the blade, just works flawlessly. good great product for great price and outer look of the product looks cool and stylish and a color that shows how the product would be only useful for clean shave...other blades are totally unusable. and just to clean shave...don\\'t buy this product. no value for money product is very good but amazon service is not good, inside the box bill was torn and crushed. very nice product. best in class its last\\'s long in a single charge than any other. its an amazing product... dont hesitate to buy it! the electric shaver is very handy and easy to use. the form factor is ergonomic. the bare blade gives a very close shave which is almost equivalent to a razor. blade will get blunt after few months of usage. you have to buy new one which costs 800rs. its better to buy regular one, this is neither good as trimmer nor good as shaver. i got this product on 15 august. i used it only once and now it\\'s not working. amazon says the return period has ended a day back. can someone help what to do? amazing the shaving setting is not as perfect as razor shaving. also precise shaving is not possible due to wide blade. the product is good. one blade is good for headshave aswell, i brought one and tried it works great its very close to a traditional blade.. very handy and easy to use. over all one blade is certainly the one !! i gifted for my brother and he just loves it! well - a smaller head could help clean up hair around the ears as well !!. otherwise a handy product. good one. it gives a clean shave. as good as a gillet blade ... but u have to go slow . u can\\'t rush into the process .. blade\\'s holder broke after few months use. it’s a good product but i was expecting more! i sort of started missing my older trimmer! the razor shape is more marketing than actual game changer! purchased in june 2020 but unfortunately not working from august month of 2020. worst quality i think so i did not expect from phillips this quality. it can trim like shaved. smooth while we trimming. easy to make shape of beard. it\\'s hard to cut 10 inches hair. it can trim 6 inches hair very easy. its battery life is good n also easy to clean but only thing that i didnt like is that it is not good for clean shave only good as a trimmer it is very nice experience to use philips oneblade. nice product but should have a cleaning brush and an extra blade with it. good product.. but the replacement blade cost 800 rs. which is very high. company needs to reduce it. this product is great for trimming but fails to cleanly shave as cleanly as razor blades.. overall quality of the product is good as expected by philips. it is good as a trimmer. however does not give a close shave like philips aquatouch.. awesome does not provide a clean shave as depicted in the ad or pics. good only if you want to groom your beard or have a stubble. product is good but as per company it work 24 shaves aprx. but actually it works april 4-5 shaves after that blade not working properly had bought for shaving..bad product.. not effective for shaving.. gillette is better.... waste of money... no return policy.. amazing trimmer .....comfortable to use on all part of body. hoped to have few power mods in it but apart from that it is a good thing 👍🏻 this product is awesome. it has osm look and works properly, the trimmer has an acception of blade which is loosely packed on the machine but works very well easy to use, ergonomic and value for money are just understatement. oneblade is the best grooming kit for travelers. not useful for hair cutting. clean shaving is not possible. cost is very high when compared to use. totally useless item. before buying go through other items. very sorry that we did not meet your expectations.badly experienced with the product not even used twice now it is not in working condition.take up the issue it takes a lot of time to charge simply awesome does what it is meant to do very well. i would have preferred more battery life but all trimmers have that problem. otherwise an excellent product. value for money nice its best for clean shaving and not makes your skin stretch with blades its best for one you are looking for clean shaving one of the best trimmer i have ever used. every men should try this. it is easy to use and clean but it\\'s battery life is not best one of the best product from philips. two sided blade helps to style your beard perfectly..runs smoothly on skin and it has also a protecting cap which makes it easy to carry.. this product is good quality this trimmer is perfect for those who want to clean shave, on the contrary,i will not recommend those who have long beard , because here is no option for long beard. a perfect product. never thought shaving would be this fun. works better than a razor.. tip: use the product against the grain for better result. battery life is nice, easy to use and easy ro clean 🚿 nice trimmer a splendid innovation for beard grooming. easy to use , absolute precision , remarkable styling and time efficient. worth every rupee all in one i had bought this for a gift and when the box was opened the power adapter was not working from first go.. very poor quality inspection check really good product good product better than other competitive brands it is as well as blade ...almost 00 saving...but difficult for hair cutting very good and clean saving i have taken a lot of time to buy the trimmer,butthis is excellent one and very nice,no need to have second thought.i highly recommend. battery life is less, but surely it\\'s value for money shaver & trimmer. very easy to use, works as smooth as a razer and easy to clean. excellent for shaping. but u should know how to use it or it will be very uncomfortable when u don\\'t gey desired shape of ur beared it is skin friendly and very comfortable to use it. i like the product very much. it\\'s an excellent product...very useful for all kind of beard shape and trimmer.... thanks amazone for providing this lovely product of philips. good product best trimmer in cheap price in phlips brand must buy for those who need zero precision trimming. have been using it for couple of months now. really good. is fine but the price is too high would be nice if the price was low awesome i am using form 3 month it working good. and good for skin..i recommended you to buy... took 1 hour to trim properly. one of the worst product ever. don\\'t believe the positive comments.. amazon/philips should refund the amount. again an awesome product from phillips. used it flawlessly without any cuts or nicks. very well designed. not to give a second thought before buying it. worst product it is worth to but at this price. clean shave is very good without cream. over all very good product it gives you only 90% shave only and takes more time for shave.better go to conventional shave with your comfortable razors. blade quality is not good. i had tried this iten when return time has passed otherwise i return this product. i lost my money in this product. total waste of money. you can not trim your hair with this. bad quality of blade. don\\'t know why amazon had recommended. poor quality product. excellent product...made in indonesia.....clean shave with trimmer...very smooth on skin...superb... good product by philips useful for senior citizens they can shave easily with this razor instead of going to barber at the time of coronavirus epidemic the product trims well. it would have been better if several trimming lenghts were possible instead of the 1mm and 5 mm options only. the material was damaged when i get my order i see that it\\'s damaged ! i didn\\'t use the material because it was damaged so i want to complaint about it please don\\'t buy this product 2 cuts in first use itself. as claimed it did not give me clean shave. i have hard beard and it could not give clean shave even after two times. worst as a trimmer, blade limited use. new blade costly. one of my friend suggested and really disappointed with the results this product is outstanding.... just little high price. generally i don\\'t write reviews. but couldn\\'t resist on writing a review for this shaver. it is awesome. gives a very nice shave, saves a lot of time. both trimmer and replacement blade are to costly , not easy to shave but it looks good.. battery life is average not easy to use but easy to clean you never need a barber... gives close shave without irritation... excellent. it shaves almost as good as a gillette blade. terrific. replacement blade is very costly. bad product. nothing works. neither functions as a proper trimmer nor as a shaver. waste of money. it wasn’t delivered with one replacement blade as per description using this product for more than six months and all i can say is not every trimmer is as good as this one. please go for it best trimmer to buy. very nice build from phillips best product till now what i experienced if you’re looking for clean shave with regularly use. don’t go for it.. it’s blade not worth price.. battery life is good rest all worst. blade gets blunt too fast...starts pulling hair in a couple of trims....useless for head... best good best trimer not good for thick beards gives close-to-a-clean-shave (when used without a given trimmer).. brilliant. i bought this for my husband. he loves it. quality and usage wise it is good. super it takes 8 hrs for charging. suburb result. easy clean shave don\\'t go for this product. only money waste. very bad experience with this product. charger pins fit very loosely in any socket, indicator does not blink to indicate charging very nice trimmer....it does its job easily and perfectly.good innovation from philips.. thank you amazon too.... philips one blade shave and trim machine gives very much soft and comport feeling,battery life is much better,more ever this trimmer very handy and easy to use.we can use both side no spare blade available on line as well as in my city.. if you need spare you must travell 150 km.. must consider before purchase i thought philips products are of high standards but this product stopped working after only 3 times. highly disappointed good product. overall great it\\'s worst product you should not considered to buy this stupid products if you want to buy you either but a trimmer or shaver but not this product good one blade is changeable this is not good. it means until you live n use this product u should wast u r money for its blade. nice scam this is not charging, manufacturer defect, testing not done before sending, realy unhappy, request you please exchange my trimmer good shaver is excellent but one who keeps little longer beard, this product isnt for those. doesnt have much trimmming choice. good quality easy to use. my skin is sensitive and use to shave regularly, it\\'s helpful for me only one blade received with the trimmer , not 3 as shown in picture battery life is poor. 8 hours of charging for 45 min!!!. replacement blade is very expensive. performance is ok it can not do proper clean shave. small hair remain not too big. way smaller than the 0 trimmer received a returned product..which must have been used by someone...scraches can be seen on the trimmer used other models by philips...but first time not satisfied....risky...anytime you may cut your skin... good nice product by philips as well as battery life battery takes long time to recharge.. razor ok. cleaning is simple does not give that clean shave as its been shown in television. not very happy with the product it\\'s not worth, company is literally trying to make money by making us buying bew blades again and again.. i didn\\'t expected this crass from philips. got exactly what i was looking for..shaving without irritating my skin and no pain..its so easy to use and gives a close shave..blindly go for it best trimer or can say shaver.. will suggest.. negative about this product is that you will have to change the blade after 3months and that costs. it\\'s a best trimmer i have ever used, it trims like a clean shave, build quality is also strong. you will definitely feel worth buying it, don\\'t look at the price just go on with if your budget allows it.using this in shower and working fine. nice experience.. no scratch marks on the face . no irritation .. superb product does it job.. nice plz don\\'t west your money product is so bed withing 1-2 month blade not working and customer care or any company person not supported.. nice and value for money a must have product for grooming... although it takes time for the baldes to adjust with your skin.... battery life is bad , offline product and online product is different . offline product is giving 60 hours of back up after 4 hours of charge. please return my product as it is damaged good product good product easy to use. a great product. superb battery life. easy to clean. well packed item is looking good but it remarkable peice so please replace new peice as early as possible good for emergency hair trimming by family member during lockdown. safe to handle. have to check with the blade life as not used much. very easy to use... good battery life, great mechanism this is a really good shaver and shaper cool trimer working perfectly no complaints found .. you need atleast 5 passes through the beard to fully shave it. also little strands of hair go behind the blade and is impossible to remove. awesome product easy to use affordable price awesome amazing product easy to use and best battery back as compare to other similar products.. feels smooth i like this product from philips. it\\'s very easy and comfort of trimming is awesome. no pain while trimming. if you need a shaver then one blade is best option, and trimmer is good for light use,. if you need only a trimmer then it\\'s not for you the design and handling is good but the blade is some how cost i like it will do zero shave but while trying for 1 or 3 or 5 it’s very poor this trimmer is just for the zero shave i bought it 3-4 months back the blade was very delicate , it broke . so i need the front blade , is it possible otherwise my trimmer is of no use now. super 1 no. nice product from phillips working awesome! i used it very nice no skin irritation good product good good good not useful for shaving awesome product but it should be one small brush slippery and shaver blade fragile and breaks easily. replacement blade not available and costly it is a very handy and useful product from phillps very easy to use and clean.totally designed for premium customers. very good product, easy to use and it\\'s clean shave also easy to use and very helpful. good product and very easy to use quite useful for shaving trimming of beard..... good product does its job product is very good but oneblade is not working in future days buying again oneblade so blade cost is very high because of customer mide set charging cord is very lose and it will not get charge if u dont hold it till it is charged good technology, first time ever seen competition to gillette shavers... very nice product for beared and mustache . please don\\'t buy for hair cutting i hardly used for 3 shaves & now i need to replace blades which is costing around than rs.1600. so, it is too costly to maintain. trimmer stoped working, purchased last year july. initially charging was trouble, now your product is not working. you should buy good product for beard trimming and styling......all good blade plastic low quality, or i got duplicate, it just broke off. feviquik didn’t worked as well.. wasted money. plastic low quality great product. got it for 1750. battery life average. very user friendly, handy too👌 with this shaver you can make very clean shave, if you are thinking to buy a shaver then must go with it, you will love it..... the only thing i don\\'t like is the blade is very fragile... blade was broken after falling off the bed only and it was not even that high best product .. worth your money ...easy to use concept... battery life is good... and it\\'s design makes it more easier to use while trimming or shaving. good product. maintenance high as blade needs replacement for every 4 months and it is expensive. happy with the product but the cost of replacing the blades is too high its like you can purchase another trimmer with cost of these blades this item is good but dont purchase from cloudtail. complete fake seller useless service. not a worth to buy stay away from this product shaving is not smooth does not look like philip product very good not a proper shaver , not a proper trimmer . wonderful nice product with good trim & shave both. this product is not working, i want to return it or if posible i want some exchange offer for this...please advise. very useful product the surface of the blade is very small when compared with other trimmers, so it is very hard to trim all the areas having that small blade buy must force and police members and software personnel. because this product was amazing duty for daily users don\\'t buy this product if you opt for shave ,bakwas h . in box itself it is written not too clase ,keeping your skin feeling soft ..... they are cheating us very useful device. very convenient. very safe. very user friendly. top level quality product. works smooth and silently.. value for money. this product is easy to use but if we keep it for 8 hours charging we are able to use it for 45 minutes the product is good but the light while charging it is not displaying, so is it a defect or the product does not have a desplaying light? worst product!!!! dont buy it.... its js 3 mnth of purchase... i rarely use it..with just 3-4 times of use the product isnt working...... it\\'s have a battery problem battery drain too early. in one time charge there is only 2 time use means only 10 mins pls help phillips i can not see indicator of batery. how much time remaining. cleaning of cut hairs also problem. no cleaning brush is given along with set product is not working as shown in discription in discription it is shown as clean shave but it is just trimmer shaving and not useful for regular shave nise awesome 👌 very handy lightweight and easy to use .. overall excellent trimmer, happy i chose the right one worst product please dont buy. it will check your patience and didn\\'t expect this kind of useless product from philips. amazing product and pretty handy to use... didn\\'t received the oneblade replacement blade with the product though.. as was mentioned.. easy to use 😍😍, good at all battery life should be extended....... thanks philips!. thanks amazon! when i open the box there is no warranty card and this product give u 2 years warranty now if i have any problem so who cn help. me phillips is the only name. that is enough for trimming. i always choose this product. thank you amazon for on time delivery. i think its just a trimmer not a shaver . it has the body of a shaver that acts like a trimmer clean clear saving.frist class product.i use many reger nut this is so good and i m satisfy with this product. pros - easy to use and clean. cons - 1mm is nearly like clean shave. great for near full shave trimming. easy on the skin. product blade clen saveing succes .but 1mm 3mm 5mm not sucess seving cut blade long life not future not work proper seving cut sucess . everything is fine but the blade design should be changed. i mean who\\'s gonna pay rs 800 to change the blade in every 4 month. useless product....not clean shaving..... after shaving have skin burning..... battery is great but shevhing is not good compares with shevhing machin extra blades to costly. best trimmer. easy to use. awasome battery life. smooth and comfortable to use. water proof . best in class. don\\'t buy vey tough to use and run very dry worst to worst product totlly mony waste i throught this product outside the home product not working. cost of blade is very high also the material of the blade holder is very weak not bad first time i used product is worst. after use of 10 days it was not working its awesome trimming like shaving without comb its performance is very good but if you are buying to use it with comb then you should not consider it. not good for body grooming very smooth on the skin.. you can feel your smooth skin after shaving. everything is perfect except cost of blade is very high and it should be less than 200 inr / piece. ब्लेड सिर्फ दो महीने ही प्रयोग में ले सकते हो अगर आप हर रोज दाड़ी करते हो तो smoothest one i have ever used the best trimmer i ever used ! razor break during trimming. i used to trim very less, during trimming . new single razor cost approx 900₹ . very expensive gives a really close shave but feels like a trimmer. its a original product. value for money. can\\'t find any product from market for this rate nice product but replaceable blades are expensive. perfect for men and a good shaving good product from philips but the blade of the trimmer have to be change in 4-5 months and the cost of the blade is 800 rs but in the other hand side. it was a good shaver and a good trimmer i used once after got delivered and it is easy to use .styling of bear trimm is very comfortable and easy.battery life also is good. just deliverd..... first impression is good..beatiful to see this product... excellent product i have been cheated. product display showed three blades. i opened the pack today. no extra blades. there is only won fixed with the clipper pls i want return it because it\\'s malfunctioning.pls guys make it return. it\\'s waste of my money i thought i should give few tries to it but it\\'s not worth it the trimmer is not easy to operate , as well as it does\\'nt trims hairs as depicted by the company. not satisfied superb for every man it\\'s nice shaver . i think philips made really grate product.. easy to use. and it\\'s really clean shave.. i rate this 08/10 it is not perfectly fine to be used it doesn\\'t work very well better than the older philips trimmers the quality of the product is not good. the blade was broken after single use. and new blade costs 800rs. good product value for money battery life is just awesome. easy to use. and saves time... cool except battery very handy, easy to operate & classy! product is good and friendly use over all the product is good but the problem is battery life after charging for 8 hours it will give only 45 min backup very bad part of it definitely one of the best product. easy to use . worth the money , even though its replacements are expensive but overall good product amazing product this is a fine shaving machine like but battery life is ok just go for it. [. for this prince is is the best and reasonable gives even trimming.. not sure about battery life.. now it is good ok not work for daily shavings8 really worth buying, value for money no charging indicator worst trimmer for the standards normally offered by philips this product is duplicate philips qp2525/10 oneblade. 3.00hrs recharges use max half an our charger stopped working after one charge. not build for heavy lifting. blades are for delicate use only good product for daily use one of the best blade i have experienced in this price range! has become my go to choice is just a couple uses. the trimmer works perfectly excellent trimming but it is not tht much powerful.....the size adjustment is not accurate does..... the product is very good. i had been using it regularly for trimming..it\\'s easy to use with attachments and safe. i rate 5/5.. its such a sleek product with smooth performance. blade losses it\\'s sharpness only after 3-4 shaves.. not so amazing product easy to use.... but brand seal is open it\\'s an amazing product! it\\'s extremely simple to use with an excellent battery life. best product. very easy to use. and shaving just got smoother like never before. philips is a trusted brand. best trimmer so far. very nice product easy to use. it should indicate battery status. else satisfied with the usage and handling. it\\'s recommended. this is a great product. i must say , it’s battery life in incredible. excellent for shaving & trimmer. easy & comfort totally worth it. the best part about this trimmer is it isn\\'t only the trimmer, it\\'s the combination of trimmer and shaver both. can\\'t ask for more :d it is easy to use and clean it is safer to. use i have used many trimmers this shaver. best one one i have use it\\'s just a good looking products with lots of issues such as: doesn\\'t work with chargers on, not that comfortable, will recommend to buy philips trimmer rather one blade nice worth every penny spent overall a good trimming and shaving experience. looks good and works even better. good product good product nice product as still i haven\\'t used much to tell about battery life... i believe in philips products... so i can assure it lives upto the mark... awesome product !!! way better than chinese scrap.. very easy to use and handle.. gives very good result. it is not sharp & smooth cut like double edge blades. it is waste of money very useful in our daily busy life. provided clean save in no time without any nick\\'s & cuts. must buy. terrific purchase. i love it. very good cutting speed but the only problem is its battery life....45 mins run time after 8 hours charging is unacceptable... nice product, easy to use, good battery life usefully amazing product good but costly dear sir adapter is not working charging is not working it\\'s not working properly and i used it after the return period so couldn\\'t return it. good product but battery life is very bad , please replace my product , and give me new product shaving has become so easy to use. really like the product and very easy to shave. would recommend to others blades are very worst, it blends just for a single use. i never expected this from philips worst trimmer ever , not at all waterproof not working now ,only used 5-6 times in 7 months. don’t waste money in buying this its a worst trimmer ever battery life is to short ..... its my to i buy this trimmer.. give my refund or exchange the product best one so far. the zero cut is amazing. can try various styles with it. nice product tbh it came with a few attachments to for required hair vut length and is actually a nice substitute to a razor shaving not proper after 2 shaves. it provides sgave like trimming. easy to use, clean. trimming in less time. no cuts on skin. there was a hairs in the product..the product was already used before delivery. terrible battery life, not at all recommended. also, too fragile, blade broken just after a single slip. no value for money. my husband used it for quite some time, and liked it. it\\'s really good.its gives you clean save😉 the blade hinges broke just within 6 months. its a complete waste of money. the replacement hinges cost around 850. does not give a perfect clean shave, but it\\'s ok. easy to handle and it requires effort from us for a perfect shave waste the trimmer battery is very poor and gets down in five minutes. blade of trimmer is not good. need to replace after one time use. very good product nice, can made fashionable very good trimmer + shaver not good product. clean shave with no hassles of shaving cream or soap is the best part using this trimmer/ shaving machine. blades not in new one best trimmer/shaver in this segment. go for it. seller is genuine , received good quality pouch too keep combs . yeah i like this product!. worth it.. the blade was very soft while you shaving your face.. go buy it. innovation at it best... one observation, i found some difficulty in neck part shaving.. otherwise it a awesome... waste product. broken within 10 days of delivery amazing product! easy to use and has great smooth results satisfied with the product very easy to use poor blade.. hardly run for 10 days very pathetic products. even not work properly.. it cut hairs by upside blade and downside blade not cut a single hair awesome product for beard trimming and removing body hairs. easy to handle and work efficiently even on private body part. it\\'s very worst to use for head bold . third class.. sticker more in head hair. as they r showing it\\'s not like that . if blade damages you need to spend 1000 for blade. i don\\'t suggest it’s just wow battery life good works perfectly great writing this review after 4 months of use. just wanna day go for it. this is a great trimmer. but very sensitive and sharp... one must use this carefully.. which is not possible by most men looks good but shaving the way ad was displayed its not upto the mark good very good awosme thank you amazon fir this awsome product amazing product amazing one looks so premium....don\\'t bother about the blade replacement it\\'s duration depends on ur use precise + powerful + hitech = nice shave. loved the product. revolutionary indeed. would have loved to get a small pouch to keep the accessories and charger. ये घटिया चीज़ मैने14 सितम्बर को वापिस की थी.... मुझे अभी तक रिफंड नही मिला । excellent, very smooth and lightweight. cleaned with water and is working well. liked the usability. dos not have enough illustration on application of use इस प्रोडेक्ट से अच्छा आप किसी गरीब को देदेना ये रूपये अगर आप ये प्रोडेक्ट लेते हो तो टाईम ओर पैसे दोनो बर्बाद कर रहे हो happy with the product so far..very easy to use. trims smoothly.. great quality do not buy this product it is not suitable for shaving and for triming also it is very hard good product that product is old and other anyone person used it hair is that product i don\\'t like that delivery options charger is not good very easy to handle. minimum care. about battery life cannot be written as it is procured just a few days back. it\\'s really an awesome product!. price is also perfect as per the product.. totally worth to buy! if you can\\'t charge it for 8 hours don\\'t buy this. it needs hell lot of charging time. design is superb. handling is very easy. we can make sharp cuts , edges easily .price is also in budget. we can do clean shave ordered for multipurpose but its just an shaver nothing else i want shaver pluse hair trimmer. not upto mark. this product is not getting on only. i bought this product on june 7 today it is not getting on. i am really frustrated easy to clean not good suddenly it\\'s stop working i baught new charger then also it\\'s not working not equivalent of normal shaver. there is no facility for return, if you don\\'t like product. it\\'s a very nice product for young boys. 👍 this product is not suitable for many people. it takes a lot of effort to take the beard. so, it is an average product not good my husband loves this good product useless product.. flimsy too!. the blade needs to be replaced which is expensive.. regular hair clippers are better only one month of used. trimmer is tottly not working please. arrange to replace i like its grip, look and colour 👌. but dislike the parcel packaging, it was tore from bottom, and its main box was also tore. poor battery is not charging battery life is less, esle the product is too good. super easy easy to use. smooth on the skin!. poor battery life. no battery signal, not even low battery indicator, but very to use and smooth trimmer. gives a good, quick, dry shave works smoothly. cannot be used for very clear shave . it is a trimmer only. good quality & on time delivery 🙂. nice product 👍 price is higher as overall performance, should be around 1200 to 1500 liked it very much. easy to use and style the way you want. excellent very smooth working. best product not worthy. after using 4times trimmer got stopped working please dont go for it the product isn\\'t working. not able to charge it\\'s defective. need to be changed immediately easy to use but not for clean shave. worst product,if u want clean shave then its not for you,after using this i got burning sensation pls don\\'t go for it not that clean shave , as seen in ad,s. but can manage for emerjency use the trimmer is not working after 10 to 12 uses. now it is dead not charging.... how do i make a complain on this product. product is not working. speed of timer is very high and dangerous to use. after using two- times dur to its vibration and speed it is not safe to use. not much recommended. go for aquatouch 3in one trimmer plus shaver. blade assembling part is very deligate, within one week blade assembling part is broken. blades price is too high easy to use..but didn\\'t knew that we have to replace the blades after a few uses..so it increases the cost. not clean sev killer product good battery life one bed thik not charging indicator nice products...fast and perfect.. cleaning it properly after a shave is the only problem i encountered.... otherwise it\\'s top notch. good for beard styling. comfortable and sleek. i like it sheave like rezzer i actually got this for my brother easy to use n skin friendly gives smooth finishing highly recommended i search for this type of trimmer,which one running smoothly and it\\'s one blade work. mostly i liked that. wrost product. never bought it. automatic off while you are using. this may effect your face and causes many disease. just as expected pretty handy and a good shave. it takes 8hrs to do full charge but it can be used for 45mins... all the others are verithanam... this is what i wanted. easy to use, light to carry and works wonderfully nice product. very good product good sometime it pulls out the hair. but overall this is the best product available at this quality and price. nice one items quality is very bad one of the best trimmer available in the market very easy to use. battery life is good...and easy to use...but product is frangile..so be careful during use awesome product but not for heavy use. it is broken,it\\'s just 2 months, repair or help me, the shave is not as good as ordinary shaving razors.. you need to shave again after 8 hours. easy to use ...very good product ok easy to use the trimmer it would be more better if more clips for trimming is provided with the trimmer. i use this product one blade system no working perfectly. i use this comb performance use like 1 no comb very nice product, above expectations best product easy to use . not a battery back up and thickness on their razor used item provided the seal of the internal pack was broken it\\'s seems like a duplicate product delicate on skin and smooth trimming. it can only be used for triming because it doesn,t provide close shave easily. it take too much time in shaving. the delivery was timely. packing was good. and the overall performance of shaver is good. it gives smooth shave. trimmer is good.. but replacement blade is too much costly... totally not happy with replacement blade cost.. trimmer doesn\\'t have any changing indicator and centre part of trimmer blade doesn\\'t cut hair,its just for show. awesome product.. clean shave value for money nice very usefule....can carry easily any where ....very convenient to use . did not get replacement blade? battery life is good and it\\'s very easy to clean. the product is very useful. super easy to use.. the battery percentage is missing which leads to confusion. not good for shaving, you have to replace blade (800 rs. per blade), cuts skin really awesome one easy to shave and trim nice product..sound smoothly handling.. no vibration awesome battery is not getting charged after a month and it\\'s gone useless now. will never buy philips again need a shaver and trimmer?. get both in one.. its worth the money and works great it cuts skin your alot.it leaves red stains on the shaved area.cover that protects skin from is hoax.worthless battery life is not good only lasts about 10 minutes after a full charge, but very convenient to use. it’s nice i bought it for my fren and he was very happy with the gift as good as clean shave.. portable it trim properly only if we use upside down....and don\\'t use directly without cover ...it will start itching after used... a good innovative shaver cleans like razor ,if used without combs, only issue is cleaning is not easy great product from philips. gives smooth shave, wet as well as dry. thanks amazon for quick delivery. take a 8 hour for charging , price is high it is easy to use. amazing amazing amazing product .. thumbs up :) good for instance shave simple clean and clear. don\\'t buy after 5-6 shave its not working properly you need to replace blade in every 2-3 months blade cost is 799 product is good.. but it\\'s not refundable.. nd it\\'s blade is too expensive.. please check twice before buy it very good product but the blade is too expensive once your time to replace has come. i got it for my brother and he loves it! philips is always a good investment value for money recieved only 1 comb. 3 combs are supposed to come with the product. i used only for mustache and it\\'s very easy and useful so i can recommend this product for mustache. good product good product super nice looking....happy a handy trimmer with elegant design and battery life. it gives much cleaner and smooth shave. easy to use and easy to clean. much better than traditional trimmers ok product easy to use nice products for shaving and trimming... it\\'s for both young and old personalities good product. very bad product. the charger damaged within a month of use. battary charging time is to long ... its very easy to use & clean... & i m satisfy customer best ever, we can trim also as well as shave... its good with advance oneblade system... great amazon as described this trimmer is very easy to use and easy to hold. the all round flexibility of blade gives you a confidence of moving your one blade anywhere without harming your soft skin. good battery life. easy to handle. little time taking for cleaning the blade. but the rest is great. this product is already used ...this is already used by someone else\\'s ...i have received the defective used product good performance it\\'s a great product.. just that, to make it even better....,. philips could have included a low charge indicator.....! just purchased this product and 2 type of trimming comb (3mm an 5mm) is missing.really poor service i got. its very nice product battery backup is not upto the mark it\\'s easy to use and am amazing product. i am happy with it this product is very good and no doubt philips is still ruling the market in this area. this product\\'s blade is not good .i donot think its worth buying.it creates itching after shaving don\\'t buy this such a rubbish product. blade is not working after 2 shave and its too costly. it is very consistent in shaving beard amd very nice looking too. good with water resistant body. easy to charge and good product full shave quality is very good. but trimmer is absolutely hopeless, doesn\\'t work at all. good.... all in one... easy to use... easily damaged heavy cost and blade is not that much good . spending this amount for this trimmer is that much worth it. a good trimmer but not effective as a shaver thank you philips for creating such a good best product...its performance superb this product.will not shave trim only useful for mustache trimming.waste product value 4 money. missing carry case best outer side of blade got damaged within 30 sec of use. super frazile. cleaning takes lot of time. super product easy to use and easy to clean awasome battery life very average performance nice product and quality i like the product and best trimmer ever i use. basic trimmers sa kafi zada achi quality ma ha. worth it hey..! philips. this is amezing product.... \"battery life\", \"easy to use\" and \"easy to clean\". it\\'s good for trimming with 5mm set. 1 mm set is very close to clean shave look good best product eassy to used battery life ok nice product. first time use was awesome. let us take time to get 5 star after using it for 3 month blade part quality is poor quality it got broken in 3 months. i don\\'t expect this from philips. cleaning is difficult tiny hair get stuck in few places which is pain but over all good product good for use terrible product, the neck of the product broke when i dropped it on the table and the entire product is unusable bleade excellent work and good for clean saving. its a good concept but failed miserably, do not buy it not as good as i was expecting it but it full fill the purpose it’s useless and doesn’t serve its purpose. go for other philips trimmers rather than this one ease abd faster to use received only one comb as a lady, this is the best product there is in the shaving segment! just too daymn perfect! buy it!!! easy to use good product..worth for money..only problem is every 3months need to change the blade best trimmer for beginners very easy to use. perfect trimming. usage is simple and effective. best product from philips. product is not good need to use razor if u want a clean shave its very great product,one time shave ,one time trime fake product apparently. after usage of 10 minutes, battery got discharged and now not getting charged. you can\\'t shave value for money good, but more work required for perfect product. best product easy to use worth of money dont expect that you will get clean save by using this. its work like ordinary trimmer only. it is not good for shaving purpose. but trimmer is awesome it needed 8 hours of charging for just 45 minutes of use, and i needed to be careful while using it. the best product 👌 blade is broked very soon, only in one use and battery is also not working. i did not get 50% off on the ordering for blades, despite of having coupon. worth the cost but clean shave takes lots of efforts poor great product. easy to shave long battery life.. easy to operate... nice trim.. easy to clean... long charging cable... very bad product, i want to return it right away. need my money back.. blad is coming off the connector while trimming waste product.poor quality. head broken.in 4 months.never suggest phllips brand to any one. it stopped working after first charge. must for both men and women. mandatory travel accompaniment don\\'t expect a close shave. this is good for trimming hairs does not shave properly. time consuming . product not upto the mark a piece paper attached which speacks of two blades at 50% cost, please knowledge me how to claim it initially it was good, but latter it became worse, the problem is battery life and even blade is not good. best product, very fast and very easy to use a good trimmer and also a shaver, but takes a bit longer time

amazing product but battery life is worst dont buy if you want a close shave !. good for beard people its a trimmer rather than a shaver it works for shaving, trimming and styling as well. easy to use with no troubles. the blade material to too weak. it is broken in only a month use. replacement blade is also too costly. good cuts like a shaver and doesnt hurt, best till date i bought this product but returning it as product says 3 trimming combs but it has only one 3 trimmer. does not make a clean shave. difficult to use with foam so easy to use and 8 hrs battry charge works fr 24 hrs. does not work in direct power. i.e with plugin charger. good blades work for 4- months only & are changable but from where to buy ? &whates prize ? trimmer is very easy to use and clean it as well. missing combs.. fake product. don\\'t buy it\\'m it\\'s part are to costly. so it\\'s like purchase new trimmer awesome product and great experience 👍. thanks for amazon its just awesome...quality of ohilips one blade trimmer is gr8 battery life is very bad. it takes 8 hrs to charge . and work only for 45 mins after using this i really feel that this product deserves to get 5 star plus rating. it is best one n easy to use. not so smooth trim on beard, and not so perfect shaping is giving as expected. excellent product battery life is very good and easy to clean is very nice for shavers and trimming it doesn’t touch skin at all dislike .not useful for shaving. handy trimmer.. recommended. stopped working after 2 weeks.dont buy. charging not working. don\\'t buy this product. useless product,. valueless. used this product and found that it\\'s easy for clean sev but not easy in beard setting the blade is very delicate and attachement are very loose to use. the blade costs 4000 its is very good in shaving but don\\'t have charging indicator and comes with the bill. iam not getting the replcable blade in online. pl send the details of the blade model. don\\'t buy it.. it is useless as i gifted to my husband he is unhappy with the shave .. amazing worth the price. i don\\'t like it.. it\\'s waste of money..you have to buy blade again.. before i could come he is gone and didnot recieve my callback phone nice product very good product. blades are very sharp. also product is water proof. so no need to worry cleaning the beard completely but taking much time and effort. while cutting hair the machine has to be moved slowly otherwise it cannot take the load it\\'s a trimer bought it for my hubby. he is very much happy with it nice product..clean sheav ..no cut anyewayer...superb nice.but does not give much options to trim.your beard....look for some other philips trimmer. superb but if you have to save money to go for philips trimmer rs 800 it will be also amazing have been

class we dont like so nice very nice worst very good product its very good prodct good product super item awesome. very nice i need to return it not shaving cleanly very good thanks good the blade keeps on removing automatically superb blad damage nice very bad long lasting nice product received used product wao over all worth buying you can see in pic bellow is before amd above are after and yes!! it shaves closely after shaving with this i tried shaving with manjal blades believe me nothing came out!!. so its shaves completely. very good handy and effective although it is first time i used trimmer so finishing may not be seen inpicture but it works perfectly for what it has been invented.. not sure about blade life or battery life as that will be judged later on but product is good undoubtedly.... fantastic product. highly recommended. i use this twice a week. this does a clean shave if that\\'s the need. i have used it wet and dry and both work. well. the only unlearning required is to avoid the instinct for natural shave movements and instead go against the grain. once we do that it works flawlessly. many have talked about the poor nimh battery. i have no issues. i charge it the night before i use it. that\\'s it. this is just like any other mobile device that way. i\\'m not sure if the charger is a 110 to 240v charger. so it\\'s a small worry if you need it on your overseas trips. let\\'s cross that bridge after covid. the only bug in this is the lack of a charging light to indicate if the device is taking a charge and when it\\'s full this is much better than gillette fusion as a blade at the same time a great trimmer. definitely a one stop solution for the man i’d today like me who wants to keep a rusty shaved look few days and a well manicured stubble few days. it gives clean shave, although not like a blade of gillette but quite good if you realize unlike the blades it doesn’t epilate the skin every time you use for a clean shave. it’s sharp clipping techniques doesn’t let you feel the clipper technique.. a modern man can keep styling with its edges capability.. great product. if you\\'re looking for a closer shave, this is not the product for you. if you\\'re looking for a quicker, easier shave without foam or water, this is the product for you. i\\'ve been using this for about 2 months. i\\'m quite happy with it. don\\'t see myself going back to foam and razer. i use it before my bath every morning. you can\\'t use it after your bath as you end up with the hair shavings falling onto you or your shirt. you can wet your face and foam and use it, but i didn\\'t see that make much of any improvement in the quality or ease of shave.. best used on a dry face. the good: surely the product is very good and can be used as trimmer, shaver, wet or dry conditions. the results are absolutely impressive.. the bad: shaving using this device is at least 50% more time consuming than regular razor blades. the ugly: recurring usage of this product is freaking expensive once you buy it. philips cashcow ! nice product. it’s awesome to experience this latest technology for trimming cons. 1. the rotors are uncovered which make you pull out hairs after every stroke.. 2. this trimmer won’t work on long beard. 3. attachments are useless. 4. would leave spots of hair at places and won’t make an even cut. 5. have cutting blade on both sides, which make it difficult to style. as you would end up making a wrong cut. 6. the blade / cartridge is just attached with 2 pins. which detaches while shaving making it more difficult and time consuming. pros. design is good. doesn’t make noise. fit only for clean (.5mm) shave, when running late and doing shaves daily with razors. traditional beard trimmer and shaver are better than this. really good for shaving. gives a clean shave just like a straight razor from a barber but with no chance of rashes or any in grown hairs.. very convenient to be able to use it both ways.. would have loved it even more if there was an extra replacement blade in the package. i recently ordered this new product from philips the oneblade. i was looking for a replacement for my old philips trimmer and i think one blade is the perfect replacement and here are the reasons why i believe it is the best grooming product in the market for men :. 1. highly ergonomic design with strong grip and easy to hold body. 2. leaves no cut marks on skin. 3. keeps the skin safe and soft. 4. provides 3 in 1 features-trimming,shaving and styling. 5. provides a near perfect clean shave. 6. comes with 3 styling combs, 5mm 3mm and 1mm. 7. high on value for money this is a beautiful looking blade that does not do the job. it does not have super economical blade refills cos you would be required to shell out atleast 800 rs (two blades) if you shave regularly (5-6 times a week).. even the blade isn\\'t really any good. i have rashes everytime i shave with this cos the blade is not sharp and you would end up pressing it against your skin to get that last bit of beard shaved.. it\\'s a good trimmer, but definitely not for clean shaves.. strongly suggest one should go for the triple blade option of philips. the one blade is a powerful technology with giving cutting edge results. the product is nice, handy and travel friendly also being a waterproof is a + +. my experience so far is good as the blades are really sharp which give a precise look to your beard incase you trim and can really give you clean shave look incase you wish to remove all but it can take time for some to get a good grip so that you can drag the trimmer fluently like the old school trimmer types.. i cant say any cons of the product as philips is a trusted brand in mens trimmer as well so i think you should give it a go and update your grooming kit. totally an unique product.. you will love it.. trim, shave, style all with a single product.. best part is skin feels so smooth as compared to traditional shaving. the shave is not close one. it cost\\'s as much as the most expensive blades you can buy (like the 5 blade gillette fusion) and to top it all they offered a discount on the 1st purchase of 50%, but after purchasing that, didn\\'t deliver. can\\'t believe a big company like this being dishonest and disorganised. the connector that connects body to blade is fragile n breaks easily. i broke it twice n bought blades worth 800 each.. 2. there is no where to reach out for support, in case u need charger or repairs.. lying in my cuboard gathering dust !. don\\'t buy it please !!. siddharth clumsy to pack and unpack. if you remove the blade for cleaning,you will not know how to fix it back.. fragile. the blade lasts for 3 months. where to buy new blades and at what cost? not worth the cost. i have tried several products in the market but this seems like a winner, so far. the moving blades work both ways. completely satisfactory to use in either direction. the round edges keep the skin safe too. battery life is decent. maybe it\\'s a bit pricey as compared to the non-branded ones but totally worth it. this is of the finest one blade trimmer which is most productive than gillet ,. its easy to use. battery life is too good. value for money. skin friendly. aqua touch ( after use you can wash directly ). cost effective worst product because you are going to spend 2000bucks just for 2month use because one your blade stop working you will end up searching for new blades and which might cost you around 2000 for 2 pieces blade , sound strange buts it a fact my blade got broken and i m unable to purchase blade as it is not in market and if present it costs similar to new trimmer .please very careful before purchasing this because after a time it will become a showcase . i didn\\'t expect this much fraud from.philips very disappointed. its very good,easy to use,as its a single blade system,with a brand of philips so i can believe on quality,no cuts,u can easily gives any alterations with ur beard, so i recommend to purchase and give five star to the product the product is very expensive. user need to change blade after every 3rd or 4th shave. the cost of blade is rs.800. its another trimmer. i would suggest to get another trimmer. first of all it is very good product. the blade is easy to remove and fix. shaving quality is far better than any shaver in market in this price.. good to buy.. thanks to amazon, i got this product at 1455 only. very nice trimmer, colour is also attractive, shaving with one blade is very innovative will have to wait till when it can be used till its last use. where i can change bettery if it\\'s not working properly .... this product this to good and as well as their proformance is really good and impresive but they did\\'t gave any type travel bag to kept their belongings and even you are souly responsible if any damage on philips one blade even you have to kept very carefully in another bag so i have participated in the phillips one blade contest and i had to write this review. this is my expectations from the product. i have previously used a phillips trimmer and panasonic, both of them did the job fairly good. but it is very difficult to style the cheek area and the neck line as it does not give have a precision trimmer. with one blade i hope that it would allow me for a close shave in those areas. it\\'s an awesome grooming toolf for men will definitely suggest to try once nd you\\'ll never go to salon for sharp styling for me, blade lasted hardly a month, and it costs more 1/3 of this easy to use and clean but battery life is low and charging time is very high. plus these are not made in india so regretted purchasing these later on. one blade is just amazing and it gives really clean and easy shave.. trust me it can save lot of time after sale service of philips is very bad think before you buy any product from @philips @philipscare @philipstvsindia @philipsindia other service provider are much better @lgus @samsung @miindiasupport excellent product. absolutely value for money!. nice for our skin. price is a bit high, but reasonable. go fo it very nice product and valuable money and easy cleaning, used battary life is good, and save the monkey long time using phillips still lives in 1990 era. 8 hours of charging for 45 minutes of use. the product is cordless only. so good she charge runs out in middle of a grooming session.. complete joke in 2021. the area between blade and the machine is really frazile. using my brother trimmer and the rubber area got broke. i even did use it forcfully.. so if you are using it try to be more attentive or just pay 850 whenever the blade broke. it is product to make only profit .. blade is linked to machine with thin plastic plate.. which breaks away in month or two. than you need to buy a new blade which cost 800 rupees.. it is better to buy a new trimmer than as this machine is just a money fetching device i love it product. it’s work very well. battery life so good .it’s charge fast also. i will recommend this to my friends also. thanks nothing great .. at this price not worth. wrong choice. theres nothing that one cant do with any normal small size trimmer. waste of money. i have been using it for the last 2 months. its battery life is also very good and it also works very well. looking for phillips oneblade pro modal, can you make it available. looking for phillips oneblade pro modal, can you make it available. looking for phillips oneblade pro modal, can you make it available one of the best innovation till date. very useful even in rush. very accurate and most importantly water proof. just go for it. its very perfect accuracy trimmer than other philips trimmers and its also very softer than other trimmers....i loved it so much awesome product, very easy to use and value for money. great product from the great brand its good innovative product provided by philips once again and rock it very easy to use lightweight styler.. comes with very handy combs, total of 3 - 1mm, 3mm, 5mm.. glides very smoothly over the skin.. best features dual edge and replaceable head. thid product is really an excellent product from phillips. very good for styling beard. it gives 3 blades and only part that i didnt liked is its battery life. you will need to replace the blade very soon (way sooner than their promised 4 months). each blade costs around 850. seems like a cheap trick to sell the blades. a good product but there is no light to indicate that the unit is charging. extremely clumsy considering it\\'s a philips product. after using it for almost 2 weeks...i have realized that it is the best trimming machine available in the market. fantastic product. really sleek design and innovative razor. gives the most close shave as possible.. quick to charge and long lasting it\\'s totally useless... and i have soft hair.. i wonder how it would totally fail on people with thicker hair... best and most effective trimer available in the market. it\\'s really good for a clean shave. it is definitely worth buying. normal trimmer is much better. u\\'ll have to spend just 1k or less than that.. no replacing blades n all i have been using it for a while now and i must say it is the only shaver which gives you a shave as smooth as a razor. but without the hassles. go get yours. it\\'s an awesome product you should try it atleast once. it\\'s an all in one grooming tool you should have in your kit blade is good , you can gently it can use therwise its cost is so high , so high expensive too expensive....just a trimmer.... blades are too expensive... it is just like a money machine for philips.... and after all this still you will not get a smooth shave.... it is just another trimmer initially it\\'s very good .. but after using it for 3 months the blade will be not sharp anymore and it will come out easily while using.. please don\\'t buy it .. awesome product.. we can trim and shave with this. we can style at home easy to use. everyone should purchase this. super easily to use and best in lockdown time. but it’s want to use one four months of one blade best blade ever....edges are too good.. and easily durable to 4 months.. best quality product.. hardly recommended to all friends. its awesome... its safe... its convenient... its user friendly... it feels amazing... strongly recommend to all of you out there.. it\\'s nice product the blade is very sensitive and if you fall the trimmer, 90% probability is that you are going to break it. if you think you can buy a new blade for half the price of the trimmer then go for it! philips one blade. the best ergonomic beard trimmer used till date.. gives a precise cut and if you would love to have a good beard day.. just go for it..! good product.. in my opinion incase of clean shave it\\'s performance doesn\\'t good. in case of trimming it gives it\\'s best very good product its costly compare to dmart. dmart selling this product on 1599 rs. its good product currently iam using this trimmer. i bought it for my husband this is utterly a bogus product please don\\'t buy and waste your money. neither trimming nor shaving..useless ..veey uneasy to use.expensive also..we have to change the blade which very costly..waste of money only smooth and comfortable trimmig. good baatery life. i highly recommend to buy thi product. you should offer a spare blade with it. very expensive. this cost is too much for the work it does. good battery life. feels really good on the skin. has a very modern look. battery indicator could have made it slightly better. the product is really nice , easy to use , crisp and lightweight .. liked the way it trims and worth the price . koi khas nahi hi packet khula hua tha dameg tha packet six month mein bled change karna padta hai blade bahut mahanga hai the blade is not easy to use.blades and adjustments are poor they don\\'t fit as expected and are very delicate. it\\'s a fine product. but the blade refill is expensive. so request philips to bring down the cost of the razor blades the product is nice. best product in market. good battery life. easy to clean. easy to shave. overall a nice product it is a brilliant investment and its really easy to use and clean. although the blades are kinda expensive but they are worth it not use for daily perpose it\\'s battery life was very low. i think this is not use ful for daily life. its one of the best blade i have ever used in my entire life.i had a quite good experience with it and i will suggest you as well the spare blade purchased as replacing blade are not that good .if shave alternate day it won\\'t work more than two months. the best tool for grooming, hands down. a grooming so nice, which is not achievable by traditional razors or trimmers. good no replacement blades are available in market ....no proper after sales support too ....pls don\\'t buy it इस्तेमाल में असान और बॅटरी लाईफ बसत बढीया .लाकडाऊनके इस मौकेपर हम सभी ने इसका बखुबी इसतेमाल कर रहे है sometime don’t work good , two time my face was little bit cut and in box three numbers 5,3 and 1 wonderful

trimmer. good and easy to use please guys don\\'t buy this product tbis is good. awesome for trimm n shave both. like to go with it. i like it easy use and very good battery great good. good stuff superb good here are thr highlights of this beard trimmer and shaver:. -a super stylish and sporty looking. -rubberised good grip. -works on wet and dry. with or without foam.. -rechargeable battery with upto 1 hour of usage. -good for styling, trimming and shaving. -good value for money pricing under 2000 on amazon. if you are beginner in trimming then this is good option according to me as it is easy to use. no worry about cuts as it\\'s blade have movement in too many directions which adjust automatically. better part is that it comes with 3 styles of blade which are 1 mm, 3 mm and 5 mm. no worries to adjust style beard. best part is that it is hybrid trimmer as well as shaver. invest once and use it for lifetime.. now some pros and cons according to my usage :. pros :. sleek and rubberised, light weighted grip. beginner friendly. 45min. battery backup. waterproof(can be used under shower). cons:. no pouch/kit in box. no led indicator of charging after using this for some days i would like to share some points. it has oneblade thing which makes it unique and and helps to provide a trim to your required style.. you can easily wash under the tap water. when it comes it battery life this trimmer provides you 45-50 min of constant usage with 180 per second move for needed trim. with the help of dual protection keeps your skin safe and blade cannot touch the skin while using it.. it comes with three combs which are 1,2 and 5 mm for your shave. you can carry it easily as it take less space in your bag. blades can be replaced after year of use which makes it compatible. the oneblade is a unique product because it\\'s an electric blade-style razor that\\'s good for both shaving and trimming. shaving without any attachments, what my husband commented about this razor is, it works mostly like a regular blade but doesn\\'t get as close. what he use this razor for, and what it\\'s really good at, is trimming his beard. i like his trim beard look. it does a great job at trimming. this is also go-to travel razor because he can use it not only to trim but shave.trimmers on top and bottom make shaving faster. clip for additional trimming are great. small, washable. price can\\'t be beat. after a week of usage i am completely satisfied with this philips oneblade. you can trim your beard as well as clean shave with foam also, it provides you smooth shave. i never do clean shave, always use trimming techniques for last 7-8 months. the design of oneblade is awesome, and the it will take around 6-7 hrs for full charging and after that you can use it for 45-50 mins continuously. worth every penny. battery life is zero, because it did not charge even once ever since i unpacked the item. see attached photos.. the power supply / charger included in the package is just fine and the led indicator can be seen glowing normally, but there is no sign or indication that the razor battery is charging.. left it connected for an hour. no improvement.. proves that philips supplied defective equipment to begin with. the product uses a unique oneblade technology for clean shaving.. it\\'s effortless, styles trims & shaves like a charm & looks super cool while doing it !. love the fact that i didn\\'t have to worry about any scratches / itchiness compared to both trimmers & shavers post a grooming session! personally i had used soo many machine...but with this is the best till date... with this machine my grooming kit is completely changed as i have too carry only this one machine everywhere... easy too clean even you can clean with water... easy too carry... light weight and almost reasonable price... i can highly recomend too everyone as they are giveing 2 year international warranty... apart from this you can change blades soo

(better than average). what i like best is that its all in one. no need for different appliances. so less clutter in the bathroom. looks quite sleek as well. and easier to use than i had expected. i\\'ve been using the philips qg3347/15 for years now but i\\'ve always had my eye on this trimmer ever since it was released. got it at a good deal and man am i happy i did! i love this product. detailing is great because of the 3 sizes that can be adjusted. battery life is excellent as always. don\\'t think i will ever change from philips and this product just cemented that fact. go for it and don\\'t think twice. there have been similar products in the market and i have used a couple of them, but since i bought phillips one blade all other products seem useless. the build quality, the sharpness and precision of the blade stands out. it just glides over your face with no irritation at all. one charge has taken me through approximately 8 trimes. loving the product.kuddos to phillips i have used many trimmers and shavers in the past but nothing comes even close to this trimmer in precision and features. i loved that this can use wet shaver as well. blindly go fot it. product is really worthy. gives a very close shave or trim whichever u wish to. i have used it twice and its performance is nice. i had other philips trimmer which i purchased 4 years ago. but oneblade outspaces that with its perfection.. although blade will last long almost 5-6 months as i dont shave frequently. will give an update after 2-3 months of its use.. as for now, would recommend this product, if u can afford. as i saw this trimmer for the first time i wanted to buy this but looking forward to the price i hesitated alot. after sometime i checked amazon at got this at a very reasonable price. very helpful for clean shave and trimming also very easy to use. the size is very small and hence fits well in hand and comfortable use. battery needs to be charged 8 hours for 45 minutes work time which is a very long and goodworking time. very good for stylers and different types of beard keepers you can style your beard very easylu, very useful and helpful trimmer, great product, i can say one of the best product at amazon and of phillips at a very great price. the first ever trimmer to clean shave, very new and innovative trimmer by phillips, clean and smooth shave with trimmer its very new and unique,i can also use with shaving cream and gel its water proof, value for money, highly recommend. nice one which i buy at a very reasonable price and that too it gives warranty too, very nice build quality and so strong and design is too good. this trimmer is doing great. it i have only had it for a short time but it cuts great with not pulling. the battery backup is good. you can easily clean the trimmer for long life it\\'s effortless, styles trims & shaves like a charm & looks super cool while doing it !. love the fact that i didn\\'t have to worry about any scratches / itchiness compared to both trimmers & shavers post a grooming session!. completely safe as it never touches the skin! awesome that it also has wet and dry capabilities!. it feels super premium to hold ! the perfect grooming tool that has ever existed till date! stylish compact and a perfect trimmer. tried using one time and its good light weight one blade serves all the purpose. and that too very smooth. charger makes it more comfortable. very happy with my purchase. go for it if looking for a trimmer. good product, but after few months the price has come to half, but again i bought one to keep it for my future usage, a good one every man i bought this for my hubby and he really loved it. got it 2 weeks, used it like 2-3 times and he seemed very happy with its performance. even i tried trimming my eyebrows and it shaped them perfectly. it operates on rechargeable battery . it\\'s very light weight and easy to operate. it trimmed his beard perfectly since he doesn\\'t goes clean shaved. its blade can be replaced, it has a marker over it. overall we are really satisfied with this trimmer. this highbreed treamer is an excellent product. water proof and easy to use. much better than other treamers. blade design is different and very effective. it took shortest time for clean shave than other treamers. colour combination and material used are beautiful. combs are of very high quality plastic. i brought it for my husband and he couldn\\'t be more happy using it... it\\'s just effortlessly smooth... he just loves using it...it has settings for trimming as well. the best part is it shaves like you have done it with traditional razor. just perfect... get your style with just one blade. the build quality of the trimmer is perfect and it fits in my hand perfectly. it just glides on the face leaving no hair behind with not cuts or nicks, its almost close to blade shave. this brand gives 2 year warranty on product registration. trimmer is fast and got charged quickly. the grip allows to hold tight and it shaved the very thick beard of mine. the blade can be taken out and cleaned again can be fitted back which is a great advantage which i liked. the trimmer is countless as well with amazing battery life. the best part of this trimmer which i found is the battery life. it trims the beard sharply and easily. it has good colour and shape. the charger is sleek and charges it pretty well. it is very to easy and is ergonomic.. i would surely recommend it to others. this is insanely coolest trimmer i have ever used. this is all in one, if u need complete shaving, this is the best thing or u just need to shape ur beard this has the best features to do it so. over all best product so far a product which can be brought by one who shaves daily or even for a guy like me who uses it once in few days to trim but the best thing is use it for trimming and you can make the best style which you want or which is trending, worth buying as it is not that costly and it worth it. at the outset, this grooming device is not a replacement for your shaving blades, however it does give you the next best shave minus the cuts, rashes and nicks! it is sturdily built and is worth the money spent. now, if only the consumable blades were priced lower! lightweight and sleek design. very handy to use.. you need not carry a trimmer and shaver when you travel as this can act as a shaver as well.. it styles trims & shaves like a charm & looks super cool while doing it probably ok, but extremely expensive for what it is, considering there are other options available on amazon that are much cheaper. i find it annoying when brands decide they command a premium simply based on their name. the battery life is really long and the grip is perfect. also this is water proof and hence can be used with foam and shower also. i was using a shaver before this of philips only and this one is far superior and fast. this is the best trimmer i have seen till now . it looks great and it have good battery backup . the design gives a good grip during itsb use . this can use both the purpose of shaving & trimming. very effective for the clean shave. and easy to shape your beard. nice grip and convenient to wash. battery is also good, it last for around 4-5hrs ( use ). excellent product. works very well. trimming and shaving both works fine. the only problem is, motor vibrates heavily, we can feel the vibrations in the hand even after the use. a very good substitute to the old razors, with much better efficiency and precision. no gel or foam based cream to be applied before shaving, can be used directly on skin. it takes off the minute of hair and gives sharp cuts. with good battery life and flexibility of blade that helps movement in any direction, it has made life easy. this is the nice trimmer for shaving ,it\\'s dual protective system protect the skin to touch and it\\'s really helpful to shave safely,and if has three trimmed i really like it. an perfect product for men, to ever get with all in one in single package.worth buying, trims off very well with good shape excellent product and its really worth of money, but when i tried to buy the blades...the cost was very high. this philips one blade trimmer is easy to use. it can be used for styling as well as trimming even to the extent of clean shave. nice. superb. fantastic.. it\\'s too good for clean shave. trimming so so. for trimming purpose, go for another philips trimmer.. totally value for money.. battery life is good, but not too good. can use 6 to 7 times after a full charge. the product lacks a battery indicator.. the cost of the blades are expensive, must be inexpensive.. must include a brush to clean the head and the blade.. thanks nice product. must buy & it is also best gift option.value for money. just awesome product. battery back up time is very bad, scratched seems like old. 100 % waterproof. best is the word. thank you philips. great product. good battery life, easy to use and easy to clean good ok i don\\'t know what the body because i did not give it a try but my face still hurts thinking of this product one blade resolve every kind of shave trim. really awesome experience. i really like the oneblade; it cuts close to the skin and has a long battery life. the delivery guy was pathetic like doesn\\'t know how to talk or deal with a customer!
